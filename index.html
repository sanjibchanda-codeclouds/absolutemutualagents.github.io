        <h3>We Specialize in Burial Insurance.</h3>
        <p>The most important thing to understand is that <b>burial insurance is a life insurance policy.</b> It’s just a very specific type of life insurance.</p>
        <p>The people who buy these policies do so to ensure their end of life expenses won’t become a burden to their loved ones.</p>
        <p>To be more specific, <b>burial insurance plans are whole life insurance.</b> Like <a href="#">life insurance for kids,</a> burial policies are always whole life plans.
        <p>Because they are whole life policies, the way they work is incredibly simple.</p>
        <h3>How These Plans Work</h3>
        <p>Burial policies work like this…</p>
        <ul class="grid_list img_list1">
          <li>Monthly Premiums Can Never Increase</li>
          <li>Death Benefits Are Guaranteed To Never Decrease</li>
          <li>Policy Cannot Expire At Any Age</li>
          <li>No Physical Or Medical Exam Necessary As Part Of The application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see, these are incredibly simple to understand. There is no fine print you need to be leery of.</p>
        <p>Life insurance is a contract that stipulates the insurer will pay out the prescribed death benefit upon the passing of the insured.</p>
        
        <p>Basically, once you pass away, your burial policy will result in the insurer cutting a tax-free check directly to your beneficiary(s).</p>
        
        <p>This will give them the money to pay for your final expenses.</p>
        
        <p>There are no stipulations or restrictions on how the money is to be used. These burial life policies merely pay out cold hard cash.</p>
        
        <p>The good news is that every funeral home in America will accept cash, so the fact that they simply payout money is a very good thing.</p>
        
        <p>If there are any proceeds leftover after all the final expenses have been paid, that money will simply stay with your family to enrich their lives as they see fit.</p>
        
        <p>Very often, life insurance plans owned by seniors result in a leftover <b>financial legacy.</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class="content_box">
        <h3>Insurers Usually Have 3 Options (Depending On Your Health)</h3>
        <p>Each final expense insurer will usually have different health ratings for their policy. Most of the time they will have three ratings, but some companies only have two.</p>
        <p>Which one you qualify for depends on your health. There is usually a low, medium and a high version (in terms of cost).</p>
        
        <p>Which plan you fall into depends on whether or not you answer yes to any of their health questions.</p>
        <h4>#1 – Level Benefit Plan</h4>
        <p>A level benefit plan is one where you say no to all their health questions. If you are approved for this plan, your coverage will 100% protect you from day one, and you’ll pay the lowest price they offer.</p>
        <p>Some carriers use the word “preferred” instead of “level” to describe their best rating.</p>
        <h4>#2 – Graded Benefit Plan</h4>
        <p>
        A graded plan is typically the medium option. You would only be offered this plan if you said yes to any of their “graded” health questions.</p>
        
        <p>Graded plans typically provide partial coverage during the first two years of the policy. For example, most graded plans will pay out 30% of the death benefit if you pass away during year one. During the second year of the policy, it will pay out 70% of the death benefit.</p>
        
        <p>The exact percentages vary by company. Year one payouts typically range from 25%-40%. Year two payouts typically range from 50%-75%.</p>
        
        <h4>#3 – Modified Plan</h4>
        <p>A modified plan is always the highest risk plan a company offers. They would only offer you this plan if you had any of the health issues that appear in the “modified” section of their health questions.</p>
        
        <p>Modified plans are always “return of premium” during the first two years. That means if you passed away during the first two years of the policy, the insurance company would only refund your premiums paid plus interest.</p>
        
        <p>Insider Tip: Modified plans are 100% worthless. Never under any circumstance buy one. If you all you can qualify for is a modified plan, just go with a guaranteed issue policy. It’s the same thing and will be substantially cheaper.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content_box">
        <h3>Who Can Get A Policy?</h3>
        <p>We can get new policies issued for ages 0-89.</p>
        <p><b>Please understand though there are a few factors that determine your eligibility such as…</b></p>
        <ul class="img_list2">
          <li><b>State Of Residence:</b> Some insurers don’t have their products approved in every state.</li>
          <li><b></b>Age:</b> Not every plan is available to all ages.</li>
          <li><b>Health:</b> Some products you must qualify for based on health. There are also plans that have no health questions as well.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most common age of availability is 50-85.</p>
        <p><b>If you are within that age range, there is a 99% chance that we can get you a <a href="#">burial insurance policy.</a></b></p>
        <p>If you are younger than 50 or older than 85, your options will depend on your health and state of residence.</p>
        <p>We can even help you get coverage on your kids too.</p>
        <p>If you want to see some example prices on children’s life insurance, here’s a detailed analysis of the <a href="#">Gerber Life Grow Up plan cost.</a></p>

        <h3>What’s The Difference Between…”Burial Insurance”, “Final Expense Insurance”, And “Funeral Insurance”?</h3>
        <p>We get this question a lot, so let’s set the record straight.</p>
        <p>“All three of these terms mean the exact same thing. There is no difference whatsoever.”</p>
        
        <p><b>Burial Insurance = Funeral Insurance = Final Expense Insurance</b></p>
        
        <p>You will consistently see us use all three labels interchangeably. Think of the words “attorney” and “lawyer”. They both have the same meaning. It’s just like that.</p>
        
        <p>If you happen to see a website suggest these terms have different meanings, run as fast as you can. It’s a bold face lie to suggest that.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content_box">
        <h3>Be On The Lookout For Companies That Masquerade Temporary Life Insurance As Final Expense Insurance</h3>
        <p>What if you were offered a life insurance policy for final expenses that would <b>expire once you reached the age of 80…</b> would you take it?</p>
        <p>Well, believe it or not, these kinds of policies do exist. They’re called “Term Life Insurance”. The word “Term” is short for terminate because the policy will terminate at a preset date.</p>
        <p>Oh, and once it expires, you don’t get your money back. Your protection simply ends. You would be 80 years old and have no coverage to take care of your final expenses.</p>
        <p>Can you imagine getting <a href="#">life insurance for your grandparents</a> and then it ends when they turn 80? What’s the point?</p>
        <p>There are some companies out there that will attempt to sell you a term life insurance policy, and they will make it appear as if its normal burial insurance policy.</p>
        <p>You will be completely unaware that the policy they are selling you expires one day. In addition to expiring, these temporary life plans will also have a price increase every five years.</p>
        <p><a href="#">AARP</a> and <a href="#">Globe Life Insurance</a> for example, aggressively market term life insurance policies to folks who are looking for final expense insurance.</p>
        <p>If you look at the very fine print, you will see their insurance expires once you turn 80, and the premiums increase every five years.</p>
        <p><b>Full disclaimer, their policies do cost less per month, but only because they expire.</b></p>
        <p>Comparing a permanent plan to a temporary one, you can surely guess which one will have a cheaper monthly premium.</p>
        <p>Look, if you want to roll the dice and take a chance on a temporary plan so you can save $10 bucks per month, more power to you.</p>
        <p>Just know, the numbers are not in your favor. Less than 1% of all term life insurance policies sold in the USA result in a death claim 😟.</p>
        <p>For final expenses, go with a permanent policy so you know with 100% certainty that your family won’t be left with a burden.</p>

        <h3>3 Big Ways Final Expense Is Unique</h3>
        <p>In multiple ways, final expense life insurance policies are unlike any other kind of life insurance.</p>
        <p>The insurance companies designed these plans knowing who would buy them and why.</p>
        
        <p>They made sure that seniors with health problems could still qualify. They also made sure that seniors could buy as little or as much coverage as desired.</p>
        
        <p>Final expense life insurance is different in three main ways.</p>
        <h4>#1 – Incredibly Lenient Underwriting</h4>
        <p>By far the most unique element to burial life insurance is the underwriting. Insurance carriers designed these plans to absorb the heavy risk of various high-risk conditions.</p>
        <p>Most of the health issues accepted by funeral life insurance policies would get you auto declined for any traditional life insurance product.</p>
        
        <p>The lax underwriting is amazing because it enables seniors with high risk conditions to qualify for a policy, so they can have peace of mind knowing their funeral bills won’t be left to their family.</p>
        
        <p><b>If you have any of the following health issues, you can still get a final expense policy that fully protects you from day one.</b></p>
        <p>(Please remember your age and state may affect your options.)</p>

        </ul>
        <p>There are many other high-risk health issues that are easily insurable as well. If you have a condition not on that list, please don’t assume you cannot be insured because you can.</p>
        <p>Again, it’s incredibly rare that someone cannot qualify for a plan with immediate coverage.</p>
        <h4>#2 – Guaranteed Issue No Health Question Policies</h4>
        <p>Even though final expense insurance as a whole has incredibly lenient underwriting there are some health conditions that are so risky that they are considered “uninsurable”.</p>
        <p>For these ultra high-risk conditions, a guaranteed issue life policy is the only solution, and thank God for them. If they didn’t exist, people with these health issues would not be able to get coverage at all.</p>
        
        <p>Guaranteed issue plans have no health questions. In fact, they have no medical underwriting at all. As long as you are mentally capable of entering into a legal contract, your acceptance is guaranteed.</p>
        
        <p>So what’s the catch?</p>
        <p><b>There are two drawbacks to these no health question plans which is why they are only to be used as a last resort.</b></p>
        <ul class="img_list3">
          <li><b>They ALL come with a 24-month waiting period.</b> If the insured should pass away during the first 24 months, the insurer will merely refund all premiums paid plus interest (usually 10%).</li>
          <li><b>The cost is much higher relative to policies that do have health questions.</b> Since the insurance company is taking on much more risk (they know nothing about your health), they must charge more money to compensate for the increased risk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>If you have any of the following health issues, a guaranteed issue final expense policy is your only option.</b></p>
        <ul class="check_list">
          <li>Terminal Illness</li>
          <li>Hospice Care</li>
          <li>Dialysis</li>
          <li>HIV or AIDS</li>
          <li>Currently In A Hospital Or Nursing Facility</li>
          <li>Alzheimer’s Or Dementia</li>
          <li>Recommended To Have An Organ Transplant (Corneal Is Acceptable)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>At the end of the day, because a guaranteed issue is always an option, there is virtually no health issue you could possess where you could not get a policy.</b></p>
        <p>Crazy right?</p>
        <h4>#3 – Really Small Face Value Options</h4>
        <p>If you can believe it, some burial insurance companies will allow you to buy as little as $1,000 in coverage.</p>
        <p>Most companies tend to have face value options somewhere in the range of $2,000-$25,000. Some carriers go lower and some go higher.</p>
        
        <p>There is no other form of life insurance that will allow you to buy such small amounts of protection.
          
          <p>This is amazing because it allows you to buy only what you need. You won’t have to pay out a bunch of money for coverage that you don’t really need.</p>
          
          <p>For example, let’s say you want to be cremated. For a cremation, you would need roughly $2,000-$5,000 in coverage to ensure everything would be taken care of.</p>
          
          <p>Whether you want $2,000, $5,000, $10,000 or <a href="#">$25,000 in final expense</a> protection, you can do that!</p>
          
          <p>You might be wondering… Can I get higher face amounts?</p>
          <p><b>Yes, you can!</b></p>
          <p>Some companies have high face amount limits such as $40,000 or $100,000. Even then, you could always buy multiple policies to get the total amount of coverage you desire.</p>

          <h3>Who Needs A Funeral Insurance Plan?</h3>
          <p>Not surprisingly, those who buy a funeral insurance policy do so because they love their family, and don’t want to burden them with their final expenses.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, these policies are a great option for any of the following reasons:</p>
          <ul class="check_list">
            <li>You have coverage now and just need a little more</li>
            <li>You don’t have the cash on hand to cover your funeral bills</li>
            <li>Leaving a charitable donation to an organization or person(s) is important to you</li>
            <li>Paying off medical bills or debts in addition to final expenses</li>
            <li>You have cash but would prefer it not be allocated specifically for funeral bills</li>
          </ul>
          <p>At the end of the day, everyone is different.</p>
          <p>  Fortunately, these plans are customizable to suit everyone who has a need.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_box">
          <h3>How Do You Apply For Coverage?</h3>
          <p>Applying for a final expense life insurance plan is easier than renting a movie.</p>
          <a>This is true even if your goal is to get <a href="#"></a>life insurance on a parents life.</a></p>
          
          <p>First, there is never a medical or physical exam to qualify. Furthermore, you won’t need to provide your medical records.</p>
          
          <p>Basically, the application will have you answer some basic questions about your health (except for guaranteed issue policies).</p>
          
          <p>The insurance companies on their end will conduct a prescription history check. They do this to validate your health so to speak.</p>
          
          <p>You won’t need to get a printout from your pharmacist or anything like that. With your consent, they can electronically analyze your medications in seconds.</p>
          
          <p>Your prescription history and answers to the health questions are how they determine you are medically eligible for coverage.</p>
          
          <p>Most applications take less than 20 minutes, and they very often render and immediate decision.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_box">
          <h3>There Are 3 Ways To Submit An Application</h3>
          <p>The medium by which you apply varies by the company.</p>
          <p>Having said that, the application process will be in one of the following three ways:</p>
          <ul class="img_list4">
            <li><b>Voice Signature.</b> You and your agent complete a phone interview with the insurance company. They take all your information including authorizations. You completely sign your application using your voice. <b>There’s no paperwork to sign.</b> Everything is done in minutes using just your voice. All voice signatures will yield an immediate decision regarding your eligibility on that phone call.</li>
            <li><b>Email Signature.</b> Your agent will collect all the information to completely fill out your application. At that point, the insurance company will send you an email where you can sign the application with the click of a few buttons. You can sign using your phone, tablet, or PC. Once you sign the application, it goes to underwriting. Some companies give an immediate decision, and some may take 1-4 business days before a decision is reached.
            </li>
            <li><b>Paper Application.</b> Although rare, there are some situations where a paper application via snail mail is necessary. In this scenario, your agent will collect all your information to completely fill out the application. Then the papers will be generated and sent to your address. You sign the documents and return them to our office. Once we get them, we call you to verify everything before they are submitted. Assuming you still want to move forward with the application, we submit them, and a decision is reached in 1-4 business days.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In case you didn’t notice, <b>at no point will you have to let an agent into your house.</b> You are able to completely apply and be accepted all from the comfort of your own home.
          Pretty amazing right?</p>

          <h3>How To Save On Your Insurance Policy</h3>
          <p>The real secret to finding the most affordable burial insurance policy is to compare prices from multiple companies before you make any decisions.</p>
          <p>But here’s the kicker…</p>
          
          <p>You cannot buy these policies directly from the insurance companies. If you were to call them and ask to sign up, they would merely inform you that you need to find an agent.</p>
          
          <p>The cheapest <a href="#">burial insurance for seniors</a> is only sold through agencies.</p>
          
          <p> The best thing you can do to find the lowest cost on a final expense policy is to work with an independent agency that represents lots of insurance companies.</p>
          
          <p>Their job is to evaluate your health to determine all the final expense companies that would accept you.
            
            <p>Then they’ll present you with quotes from all those companies, so you can decide which one is best for you.</p>
            
            <p> Working with an independent agency that specializes in funeral life insurance is just like shopping around.</p>
            
            <p> The thing about it is, you aren’t the one doing the shopping per say.</p>
            
            <p>They do it for you with all the companies they work with.</p>
            
            <p><b> When selecting an agency to work with, make sure they have the following attributes:</b></p>
            <ul class="check_list">
              <li>They represent at least 10 different funeral insurance companies</li>
              <li> Burial insurance is their focus (they aren’t a jack of all trades)</li>
              <li>They have at least two years experience exclusively with this type of insurance</li>
              <li> They have good online reviews and ratings from other customers who have dealt with them</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="content_box">

          <div class="content_box">
            <h3>Our Qualifications Broken Down</h3>
            <p>The reason we contract with over 15 companies is so that we have the necessary products to serve each individual. Remember, no one insurance company can be the best for everyone.</p>
            <p>That’s why it’s important to have lots of options to cover a wide variety of health issues.</p>
            
            <p>Even if you were just trying to buy life insurance on a newborn infant, this would still be true.</p>
            
            <p> After processing thousands of applications, we know inside and out how each insurer responds to various health conditions.</p>
            
            <p> This knowledge is critical when trying to diagnose which carriers will approve you.</p>
            
            <p>Remember, the ultimate goal is to find which company is going to offer you the best deal. Because we know how they underwrite, we can do this in a very efficient and effective manner regardless of your risk profile.</p>
            
            <p>Last but not least, our unwavering commitment is to always place you with whichever company is best for you. We are not married to any particular insurer, and we have no hidden agendas or back door deals.</p>
            
            <p>We believe transparency is critical to building a foundation of trust. That’s why we allow users to run quotes anonymously on our website.</p>
            
            <p>Before ever speaking with us, you can see up front exactly what each insurer charges. You don’t have to wonder if you are getting a good deal or if the price you are paying is competitive.</p>
            
            <p>Ultimately, we believe we have a value proposition that no other company can match.</p>
            
            <p>But you be the judge.</p>
            
            <p>If what we are saying makes sense to you, give us a chance to earn your business.</p>
            
            <p>If not, hopefully, some of our advice helps you on your journey.</p>
