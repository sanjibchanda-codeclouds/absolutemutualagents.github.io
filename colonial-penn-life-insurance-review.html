							<h3 class="text-center">There Are 3 Kinds Of Colonial Penn Life Insurance For Seniors</h3>
							<p>Colonial Penn primarily markets their guaranteed acceptance whole life insurance which is a policy that has no medical underwriting whatsoever. It always comes with a two year waiting period before it will pay out a death benefit.</p>
							<img
							src="images/options.jpg"
							srcset="images/options.jpg 1x, images/options@2x.jpg 2x"
							alt="options" class="w-75 align-center"
							/>
							<p>In addition, they also have another whole life policy that has health questions where you can be denied due to <a href="#">pre existing conditions.</a> Finally, they have a term life policy that increases in price every five years, and ultimately expires at age 90.</p>
							<p>We explain in detail how each of these policies work, and show you how much they all cost.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center">What’s The Story With A Colonial Penn Rate Lock?</h3>
							<p>Let’s be honest; we’ve all seen Alex Trebek advertising for Colonial Penn. They’ve been running T.V. ads for decades now, and the one thing you always hear him promote is the “rate lock”</p>
							<p class="text-center"><i>So what’s a rate lock exactly?</i></p>
							<blockquote class="text-center">" Colonial Penn’s rate lock refers to the fact that your monthly premium will always stay the same if you buy one of their whole life policies. "</blockquote>
							<p><b>But here’s the thing</b></p>
							<p>They advertise this as some unique and special benefit that only Colonial Penn can provide.</p>
							
							<p>Wrong!</p>
							
							<p>The fact of the matter is; every single <a href="#">whole life insurance policy</a> with any life insurance company will always have a rate lock. It’s just the nature of whole life insurance.</p>
							
							<p>No matter who you ever buy a whole life policy from, the monthly premium will always remain the same.</p>
							
							<p>Sorry but their “rate lock” is nothing more than a gimmick to trick you into thinking you are getting something special. It’s sad, but this is quite common in the advertising industry.</p>
            </div>

            <!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
							<h3 class="text-center">Policy#1: Colonial Penn Guaranteed Acceptance Whole Life Insurance | Policy Details & Prices</h3>
							<p>Alex Trebek insurance in most cases refers to this guaranteed acceptance whole life plan.</p>
							<p>Without question, the Colonial Penn program pushes this policy far more than their other two options. Call them and they will likely try to sell you this plan first.</p>
							
							<p class="text-center">Take a look at their homepage below.</p>
							<img
							src="images/homepage.png"
							srcset="images/homepage.png 1x, images/homepage@2x.png 2x"
							alt="homepage" class="w-75 align-center"
							/>
							<p>See how much real estate they give to this policy, and how they put it towards the top so more attention is paid to it?</p>
							<p>If you call them for information, there’s a really good chance they will try to sell you this policy.</p>
						</div>
				
						<!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
							<h3 class="text-center">Straightforward Whole Life Policy</h3>
							<p>Their guaranteed acceptance plan is a whole life policy. Fortunately, whole life policies are very simple to understand. They come with the following benefits:</p>
							<ul class="order_list">
								<li>Premiums cannot increase ever for any reason</li>
								<li>Death benefits are guaranteed to never decrease</li>
								<li>Coverage will not expire at any age</li>
								<li>Builds cash value that you can borrow from</li>
							</ul>
							<p>That sums up the bulk of how this policy works. As you can see, there’s not much to it which is by no means a bad thing.</p>
							<p>However, there’s a couple of other things you must understand about this policy that are extremely important, so keep reading 🙂</p>
            </div>
            
            <!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
							<h3 class="text-center">This Policy Will Not Pay A Death Benefit If Death Occurs During The First 24 Months</h3>
							<p>The main thing to understand about this policy is that it’s <a href="#">guaranteed issue.</a></p>
							<p>That means there are no health questions or any medical underwriting of any sort.</p>
							
							<p>They will literally issue the policy to anyone without knowing a single detail about their health. This is why they call it guaranteed acceptance.</p>
							<p class="text-center"><b>Now this is important</b></p>
							<p>With this policy, Colonial Penn life insurance company will not pay out a death benefit if you die from natural causes within the first 24 months of the policy.</p>
							<p>Don’t believe us? Check out what it says below taken directly from <a href="#">their website.</a></p>
							<img
							src="images/gipolicy.png"
							srcset="images/gipolicy.png 1x, images/gipolicy@2x.png 2x"
							alt="gipolicy" class="w-100 align-center"
							/>
							<p>What they will do is refund of your premiums plus 7% interest if you die during this time.</p>
							<p>It’s important to note that death from an accident (car, plane, train crash etc) will result in the full face value of the policy being paid out even if it’s during the 24 month waiting period.</p>
							
							<p>After the 24 months, your policy is active and will remain so forever unless you cancel it or stop making your payments.</p>

						<div class="content_box-sm">
							<h3 class="text-center">What Is A Unit?</h3>
							<p>Seriously, what in the world is a unit?</p>
							<p>It’s by far the most common question about Colonial Penn guaranteed life insurance. All their advertisements use the whole “coverage starts at only $9.95 per unit” as a hook to get you to call.</p>
							
							<p>We give them points for creating something that gets the phone ringing, but it’s rather misleading to say the least.</p>
							
							<p>So what the heck is it?</p>
							
							<p>Let’s start with their definition of a unit…</p>
							<img
							src="images/unit.png"
							srcset="images/unit.png 1x, images/unit@2x.png 2x"
							alt="unit" class="w-75 align-center"
							/>
							<p>Basically a unit refers to the amount of coverage that is provided to you based off your age and gender.</p>
							<p>Uh what? Let us explain…</p>
							
							<p>Most life insurance companies adjust the price of coverage to increase with age.</p>
							
							<p>For example, ABC insurance might charge a 50 year old $25.00 per month for $10,000 in coverage.</p>
							
							<p>They would charge a 51 year old $25.50, and charge a 52 year old $26.00. As you can see, the prices increase with age. See the pattern that’s forming?</p>
							
							<p>Notice how the coverage of $10,000 stays the same, and it’s the price that increases with age.</p>
							
							<p>What Colonial Penn does with their unit system is the opposite.</p>
							
							<p>With their unit system, what changes is the amount of coverage that a unit provides. The older you are, the less coverage a unit provides.</p>
							
							<p>In addition, a unit provides less coverage for a man than it does for a woman (<a href="#">women always pay much less for life insurance than men</a>)</p>
            </div>
            
            <!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
							<h3 class="text-center">A Unit Always Costs $9.95 For Everyone And The Most You Can Buy Is 8</h3>
							<p>Colonial Penn life insurance cost per unit is always $9.95 for everyone. No matter how old or young you are, male or female, a single unit is always $9.95.</p>
							<p>Everyone can choose to buy between 1 and 8 units.</p>
							
							<p>Again, what will change is the amount of coverage that a unit provides.</p>
							
							<p>Let’s look at how much coverage a unit provides for a 50 year old male to illustrate how this strange insurance pricing method plays out.</p>
							<img
							src="images/age50quote.png"
							srcset="images/age50quote.png 1x, images/age50quote@2x.png 2x"
							alt="age50quote" class="w-75 align-center"
							/>
							<p>According to their website (which the image above was taken from), a single unit would provide a 50 year old male with $1,786 in coverage.</p>
							<p>Now let’s take a look at how much coverage a unit provides to a 51 year old male.</p>
							<img
							src="images/age50quote2.png"
							srcset="images/age50quote2.png 1x, images/age50quote2@2x.png 2x"
							alt="age50quote2" class="w-75 align-center"
							/>
							<p>As you can see, a 51 year old male will get exactly $54 in less coverage for each unit of insurance compared to a 50 year old male. As the age increases, the coverage for each unit will continually decrease.</p>
							<p>On the furthest end of the spectrum, an 85 year old male would only get $418 of coverage from each unit. 😭</p>
							<img
							src="images/age50quote3.png"
							srcset="images/age50quote3.png 1x, images/age50quote3@2x.png 2x"

							<p class="text-center">Remember, you can buy 1-8 units, and each unit costs $9.95 for everyone.</p>
							<p class="text-center">To calculate how much you will pay and how much coverage you will get from Colonial Penn, use the two formulas below.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center">How Colonial Penn Guaranteed Acceptance Stacks Up Against The Competition</h3>
							<p>Below you will see a side by side comparison of Colonial Penn insurance rates for their Guaranteed Issue life coverage right next to Gerber Life and AIG.</p>
							<p>This super important</p>
							<blockquote class="text-center">" The vast majority of people should not be buying guaranteed acceptance coverage. Most folks can qualify for a policy that does ask health questions with some company. This results in substantially lower payments and no waiting periods. "</blockquote>
							<p>However, if you truly need guaranteed acceptance coverage, you will see from these numbers that Colonial Penn charges quite a bit more than other companies.</p>
							<p class="text-center"><b>Keep in mind</b></p>
						
							<p>A no health question policy from Gerber Life or AIG is no different than Colonial Penn. The only difference is the price.</p>
							
							<p>Since Colonial Penn final expense insurance has the strange unit pricing system, we can’t generate quotes with them for even numbers. However, you’ll see that we put in quotes for coverage that is extremely close to Colonial Penn.</p>

							<p>Just like all other life insurance companies, Colonial Penn Insurance Company has various age, state , and face value restrictions on their policies.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center">Why they heavily push this policy</h3>
							<p>The bottom line is this.</p>
							<p><b>It’s a HUGE money maker for them!</b></p>
							
							<p>They make a lot of money on this product for three big reasons.</p>
							<ul class="order_list">
								<li>It’s very expensive.</li>
								<li>Aside from the extremely healthy, it’s the only Colonial Penn insurance most seniors are eligible for due to their health. These same people could almost certainly be paying substantially less with other companies (and avoiding a waiting period).</li>
								<li>This is the only product they have for people who are 76-85. Even if you are super healthy but you are over 75, your only option is this guaranteed acceptance policy. 😬</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In essence, they have a massive pool of customers that are greatly overpaying which means high profits for them. We suspect this is how they are able to afford <a href="#">Alex Trebek.</a></p>

							<h3 class="text-center">Policy# 2: Colonial Penn Whole Life Insurance With Health Questions</h3>
							<p>Now if you are determined to do business with Colonial Penn insurance company, this policy (out of the 3 they have) would be your best option by far.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, this policy is much more expensive relative to other burial insurance companies. Furthermore, the underwriting is fairly strict, so few will qualify for it.</p>

						<div class="content_box-sm">
							<h3 class="text-center">This Colonial Penn Burial Insurance Is A Standard Whole Life Policy So It Won’t Change</h3>
							<p>Just like their guaranteed acceptance policy, this one is also whole life. Because of that, the policy will work in the following ways:</p>
							<ul class="unorder_list">
								<li>Fixed monthly rates</li>
								<li>Policy will never expire at any age</li>
								<li>Cash value accumulates over time that you may borrow against</li>

							<p>In order to qualify for this policy, Colonial Penn will employ two processes to determine if you are medically eligible for this coverage.</p>
							<p>They are:</p>
							<ul class="unorder_list">
								<li>Formal health questions</li>
								<li>Prescription history check</li>
							</ul>
							<p>With this information, they will be able to come to a decision regarding your eligibility. Just so you know, you do not need to take a medical exam.</p>
							<p>It’s important to note that an underwriter might request to speak with you over the phone to ask you some follow up questions.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center">A Better Way To Find The Best And Cheapest Burial Insurance</h3>
							<p>Let’s set aside the fact that Colonial Penn has terrible underwriting that results in a decline for most folks, and that their prices are very expensive for everyone but a few ages.</p>
							<p>Leaving those two huge downfalls out, there is still one other massive handicap when you are dealing with Colonial Penn.</p>
							<p class="text-center"><b>Here’s the biggest problem with Alex Trebek life insurance company.</b></p>
							<blockquote class="text-center">" Colonial Penn can only offer you Colonial Penn. They are a <a href="#"> captive insurance company</a> just like <a href="#">Lincoln Heritage</a>. That means their agents cannot represent any other insurance company other than Colonial Penn. "</blockquote>
							<p>When you speak with one of their agents, they do not have the freedom to shop around among other insurance companies to see if those companies are a better fit for you.</p>
							<p>This is inherently the biggest issue with Penn life insurance.</p>
							<p><b>Don’t worry because there’s a better way</b></p>
							<blockquote class="text-center">" If you truly want to find the best burial insurance that covers you as soon as possible and comes at the lowest price possible, you must consult with an independent <a href="#">final expense</a> agency that represents lots of insurance companies. "</blockquote>
							<p>An agency like this will evaluate your health, so they can identify which burial insurance companies are most accepting of your health issues. Then it’s just a matter of comparing each offer to isolate which one is best and cheapest for you.</p>
							<p>Now you are probably thinking… Where can I find an agency like that? Ask and ye shall receive!</p>
							<p>Absolute Mutual Agents is the agency you want to work with. We are independent, we only deal with burial insurance, and we presently work with over 20 different <a href="#">funeral insurance companies.</a></p>
							<p>Our promise to everyone is that we will impartially shop and compare offers from all the companies we represent to find you the best plan possible.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="content_box-sm">
							<h3 class="text-center">Our Promise To You</h3>
							<p>As we said earlier, if you are a 50-57 year old female or a 50 year old male, Colonial Penn burial insurance is a good deal. We can come really close in price, but they do slightly edge us out for those ages. 😢</p>
							<p>However, that’s assuming you can qualify which most people simply will not.</p>
							<p>Having said that, outside of those two small groups, we can unequivocally find you a much better and less expensive plan than what Colonial Penn life insurance company can offer you.</p>
							<p><b>This is crazy</b></p>
							<p>Most of our clients do not want to deal with a waiting period. Because we work with so many funeral insurance companies, we are able to secure coverage that has <a href="#">no waiting period</a> for over 90% of our clients.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center">Colonial Penn Insurance Company History & Financials</h3>
							<p><a href="#">Colonial Penn</a> was actually founded by AARP’s co founder Leonard Davis over 50 years ago. They are owned by <a href="#">CNO Financial Group</a>.</p>
							<p>They were one of the first insurers to offer <a href="#">guaranteed acceptance life insurance for seniors</a>. It’s by far their most popular product.</p>
							<p>Most people associate Penn life insurance with Alex Trebek. What many people don’t know is Ed McMahon use to be their paid spokesperson.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center">Their Ratings Aren’t The Best & They have Lots Of Complaints</h3>
							<p>Currently, <a href="#">A.M. Best</a> has granted Colonial Penn a rating of <b>A-</b> which is actually good. However, <a href="#">Standard & Poor’s</a> and <a href="#">Fitch</a> has dropped their rating to <b>BBB+</b>. Moore’s has their rating at <b>Baa1</b>.</p>
							<p>The one rating organization where they shine bring is the Better Business Bureau. The currently have an A+ rating with them.</p>
