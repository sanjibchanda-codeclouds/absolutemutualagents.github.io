              <h3 class="text-center">The Shocking Truth About Lincoln Heritage Funeral Advantage</h3>
              <p>Lincoln Heritage is the largest purveyor of burial insurance in the nation. However…</p>

              <p>Just because they sell the most funeral insurance doesn’t mean they have the best product.</p>
              <p class="text-center"><b>Here’s the truth</b></p>
              <blockquote class="text-center">" There is never a reason why anyone should ever purchase final expense insurance from Lincoln Heritage life insurance company. "</blockquote>
              <p>We realize that is a pretty shocking claim, but it’s true. You will find ample evidence via cold hard facts in this article to back up that claim.</p>

              <p>There’s two reasons why we say this:</p>
              <ul class="order_list">
                <li>Funeral Advantage life insurance is anywhere from <b>20-300% more expensive</b> than other <a href="#">burial insurance companies</a>.</li>
                <li>Lincoln advantage underwriting is vastly inferior compared to other insurance carriers. There are many health issues where they force you to pay a <b>substantially higher premium</b>, and they tack on a <b>two year waiting period</b> before your policy will pay out a death benefit. With other burial insurance companies, these same clients could get a significantly lower premium, and have coverage that has no waiting period.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-center">Crazy right?</p>
              <p>Now, if you meet with a Lincoln Heritage Insurance Company agent, they will try hard to convince you that their inflated prices are worth it.</p>

              <p>They will claim their Funeral Advantage program is worth it because of the membership to the FCGS.</p>
                
              <p>You can read exactly what the FCGS is further down in this article, or by clicking here.</p>
                
              <p>But here’s the real truth.</p>
              <img
								src="images/boom.jpg"
								srcset="images/boom.jpg 1x, images/boom@2x.jpg 2x"
								alt="boom" class="post_img square-shape"
							/>
              <blockquote class="text-center">" The whole FCGS membership and it’s “value” is nothing more than a sales gimmick. It was put in place as a sales tool to convince clients why they should pay a much higher premium for an insurance policy that many other companies offer at a much lower price. "</blockquote>
              <p>There’s no benefit the Lincoln Funeral Advantage program offers you that you cannot achieve on your own or free from other companies.</p>
            </div>

            <!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
              <h3 class="text-center">What Is Funeral Advantage?</h3>
              <p>Funeral Advantage is a life insurance policy underwritten by Lincoln Heritage insurance company in combination with a membership to the Funeral Consumer Guardian Society to help family members with arranging the funeral. Lincoln Heritage claims that cash benefits are paid in as little as 24 hours once the claim is approved.</p>
              <p>You will sometimes see Lincoln Heritage’s life insurance referred to as “burial insurance”, “funeral insurance”, or “final expense insurance”. They are just synonyms, for they are refer to the same thing.</p>
            </div>

              <h3 class="text-center">Lincoln Heritage Insurance Is Very Expensive- Check Out Their Rates</h3>
              <p>At the start of this article, we made the bold assertion that the Funeral Advantage program is anywhere from <b>20-300% more expensive</b> more expensive than their competition for the same exact thing.</p>

              <p>So here’s the deal</p>
                
              <p>We believe in providing cold hard facts to back up our claims.</p>
                
              <p>Below you will see Lincoln Heritage insurance premiums right along side one of the 20+ burial insurance companies we work with that sells the exact same kind of insurance.</p>
                
              <p>Please note the following when you look at these rates:</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Prices shown are at a non tobacco rating</li>
                <li>These rates are consistent with an applicant who can say no to all of Lincoln Heritage’s health questions, and has no medications on their modified prescription list</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Can you say ouch?</p>

              <p>Ya they are aren’t winning the price war at all. Heck, it’s not even close.</p>
                
              <p>As you can clearly see, they charge much more for their Funeral Advantage program compared to other companies for the same product.</p>
                
              <p><b>But here’s the kicker</b></p>
                
              <p>Mutual of Omaha is just one carrier that we represent that blows their rates out of the water.</p>
                
              <p>Except for some fringe companies like <a href="#">Metlife</a>, <a href="#">AARP</a>, or <a href="#">Colonial Penn</a>, virtually every single burial insurance company offers substantially better rates than Lincoln Heritage.</p>
                
              <p>We know what you must be thinking right now…</p>
                
              <p>In what situations is Lincoln Heritage burial insurance <b>100%</b>, <b>200%</b>, or <b>300%</b> more expensive?</p>
                
              <p>The answer to that lies in the health issues you deal with.</p>
                
              <p>In the next section below you will see all the situations where their underwriting forces you to pay up to 300% more for your burial insurance relative to what other companies would charge.</p>
                
              <p>In addition, we have taken the time to show you the actual rates, and what you could be paying if you buy through us instead of them.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Funeral Advantage Lincoln Heritage Underwriting Could Force You To Pay Up To 300% More</h3>
              <p>On top of being expensive even for healthy folks, their underwriting forces many applicants with certain health issues to pay MUCH higher premiums.</p>

              <p>In addition to premiums that are up to 300% higher, they also throw in a nice little waiting period before the policy will pay out a death benefit.</p>
                
              <p>If you deal with any of the conditions shown below, they will offer you their “Modified Plan”. That’s the one that carries a waiting period and higher premiums.</p>

              <p><b>Nuts right?</b></p>
              <p>There’s one key thing to understand about this situation.</p>
              <blockquote class="text-center">" All of the conditions below are accepted by other companies that we represent. These companies will not charge you one dollar extra or impose a waiting period on your policy. Only Lincoln Heritage will. "</blockquote>
              <p>To be very clear, if you deal with any of the health conditions below…</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Lincoln Heritage life insurance company will not pay a death benefit if you die during the first 24 months of your policy.</li>
                <li>Lincoln Heritage is going to charge you up to 300% more than what other companies would charge.</li>

              <h3 class="text-center">Health Issues That Would Warrant Their “Modified Plan” & Charge You A Lot More $$$</h3>
              <p>Any blood thinner or heart medication prescription (hypertension doesn’t count) will always result in Lincoln Heritage imposing a two year waiting period on your policy, and subjecting you to substantially higher premiums.</p>

              <p>Common events that cause someone to receive blood thinners:</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Heart Attack</li>
                <li>Full Blown Stroke</li>

                <li>Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)</li>

                <li>Irregular Heartbeat (Afib)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you have had any of those events at any point in your life, you are almost certainly on blood thinners or other heart medications to this day. Once these pills are prescribed, they are rarely discontinued.</p>

              <p>So if you’ve ever had any of those health events listed above, Heritage Lincoln is going to hijack your wallet.</p>

              <p>The rates below are what Lincoln Heritage would charge you. Furthermore, you will also see what rate you could be paying if we helped you.</p>
                
              <p>You’ll notice that we give a price range. We can’t quote just one company because there is no one company that accepts all of those health issues.</p>
                
              <p>However, all those health issues are accepted by one or more of the final expense companies we work with. This is why you see a small price range shown.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Does Lincoln Heritage Life Insurance Company Really Pay Claims In 24 Hours?</h3>
              <p>Every form of Funeral Advantage advertising will reference the fact that they pay claims in 24 hours once it’s approved. It’s eye catching and clever. We give them points for that no doubt.</p>

              <p>God forbid, if you ever speak to one of their agents, they will tout this claim as if it was the etched into the side of Plymouth Rock by Columbus himself.</p>
              <p class="text-center">So what’s the deal… <b><i>Do they really pay claims in 24 hours?</i></b></p>
              <p>Let’s get down to the facts about it.</p>

              <p>Look at the images below from their website and their online advertising. They perfectly highlight a sort of sleight of hand that’s common in the advertising world.</p>
              <img

								srcset="images/payment.png 1x, images/payment@2x.png 2x"

              <img

								srcset="images/funeral.png 1x, images/funeral@2x.png 2x"
								alt="funeral" class="w-75 align-center"
              />
              <p>Did you see how they slipped in a little phrase like “of claim approval”, or “once a claim is approved”?</p>

              <p>Here they are again; only we highlighted them for you.</p>
              <img
								src="images/payment2.png"

              <p>In case you haven’t figured it out by now, <b>no your claim will not ever be paid within 24 hours of the insured passing away.</b></p>

              <p>Now why is that?</p>
                
              <p>It’s simple. Your claim must be approved before they even consider paying it.</p>
              <p class="text-cente"><b>Here’s the bottom line</b></p>
              <blockquote class="text-center">" There is no circumstance where you can get them to approve a death claim instantly, for it to be paid in 24 hours or less. "</blockquote>
              <p>If your claim were to take 2 days, 5 days, 10 days, or a month to be approved, you would have to wait until it was finally approved before they would consider paying it.</p>

              <p>If you listen to their agents, or browse their website, you would be left with the a certain impression. And make no mistake, the impression you are left with is by design!</p>
                
              <p>They want you to think the following…</p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>You buy a Funeral Advantage life insurance. At any point you can notify Lincoln Heritage Life Insurance Company that the insured passed away. Then boom in less than 24 hours, you have a check in hand.</p>
              </div>
              <p>That is what they want you to think, but as you now know, that is not how it works.</p>

              <p>That pesky little word “approval” just messes everything up 😒.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">What About After They Approve A Death Claim?</h3>
              <p>A death claim being paid 24 hours after it’s approved is pretty good right?</p>

              <p>Yes it is. We would absolutely agree that’s a good thing.</p>
                
              <p>However, the issue is Lincoln Heritage Funeral Advantage insurance agents routinely tout this as fact. <b>The problem is a little thing called proof.</b></p>
                
              <p>Just because a company says something or makes a claim does not mean it’s true.</p>
              <div class="note">
                <p><b>Here’s a quick example:</b> <a href="#">This company</a> that was selling a $400 juicer. They sold these special juice packets that only their juicer could squeeze. It was later revealed that the packets could be squeezed by hand! Nice claim huh?</p>
              </div>
              <p>What if we said the following: <i>“Choice Mutual will help you get a burial insurance plan, and when your coverage goes into effect you will lose 10 pounds”</i>.</p>

              <p>Would you believe that claim?</p>
                
              <p>We said it, but does that make it true? Of course not! Talk is cheap for reason.</p>
                
              <p>We could put it right up on our website’s homepage too and it wouldn’t matter (although it would probably piss a lot of people off).</p>
                
              <p>No matter how many times they or we say something, it means nothing if it’s not in a legal binding contract.</p>
                
              <p>So prove it Lincoln Heritage!</p>
                
              <p>Do they have it in their contract that a claim will be paid in 24 hours after it’s approved? <b>NOPE</b></p>
                
              <p>There is no legal binding agreement anywhere in the Funeral Advantage program that makes this promise.</p>
                
              <p>You will only see this claim made as advertisements from their agents and their various forms of marketing. But open up your Lincoln Heritage policy, and all mentions of a claim being paid in 24 hours are mysteriously gone.</p>
                
              <p>Hmm… Now why do you think that might be?</p>
                
              <p>Again they just say it. They can’t and won’t prove it.</p>
                
              <p>Without proof, we call BS.</p>
                
              <p>The day they post contractual proof of this claim, we will happily retract these words. We aren’t holding our breath though…</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">A Technical Breakdown Of The 2 Lincoln Heritage Funeral Insurance Options</h3>
              <p>The life insurance component to the Funeral Advantage program is a small face value simplified issue whole life policy. There are no physical or medical exams.</p>

              <p>Qualification is based on your answers to some health questions and a prescription history check.</p>
                
              <p>It is possible Lincoln Heritage may require you to complete a phone interview as part of the application. For example, if you purchase $20,000 or more in coverage, they will require a phone interview.</p>
                
              <p>Because the policy is whole life, the following will always be true:</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Fixed monthly rates that cannot increase</li>
                <li>Death benefits are guaranteed to never decrease</li>
                <li>Policy is guaranteed to never expire at any age</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As you can see, the way the policy works is incredibly simple. It’s just the nature of whole life insurance. They are by no means complicated.</p>

              <p>The policy will pay out the set death benefit tax free to your beneficiaries upon your passing (unless you have their Modified plan) which gives them the money to pay for your final expenses.</p>
              <h3 class="text-center">Age, State, And Face Amount Limitations</h3>
              <p>As is the case with any life insurance company, Lincoln advantage has age, state and face amount restrictions on their Funeral Advantage program.</p>

              <p>First of all, anyone who is 0-80 can apply for up to $35,000 in coverage. If you are 81-85, you can only apply for $15,000 in protection.</p>
                
              <p>Their life insurance is available in all states except for New York. It’s quite common for life insurance companies to avoid New York due to the absurd amount of regulation in the state.</p>
                
              <p>Here’s <a href="#">a story</a> that perfectly illustrates the absurdity of New York insurance regulation.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Riders</h3>
              <p>Lincoln Hertiage offers two riders that you can elect to purchase along with your policy for an additional cost.</p>

              <p>The first one is a <b>Child Rider.</b></p>
                
              <p>The insured may purchase a child rider on any of their children, grandchildren, step children, or great grandchild. Children must be at least 30 days old and under the age of 18.</p>
                
              <p>The child riders are sold by the unit. One unit of coverage provides $5,000 in level term coverage for eligible children. You can purchase a maximum of 5 units. The cost per unit of child rider coverage is $2.00.</p>
                
              <p>Children covered by the child rider, may convert their coverage into a permanent plan. They must convert before they reach age 25. They may only convert to a permanent plan that has a face value equal to or less than the current value of the child rider.</p>
                
              <p>The second rider that can be added on to your policy is an <b>AD&D Rider</b>.</p>
                
              <p>The accidental death and dismemberment rider can actually be purchased as a standalone product. It can also be bought as a rider onto their final expense insurance.</p>
                
              <p>The AD&D coverage is sold by the unit. You can purchase a maximum of 8 units. A single unit provides the following cash payout:</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Accidental death benefit- $5,000</li>
                <li>Single dismemberment- $2,500</li>
                <li>Automobile accident death- $10,000</li>
                <li>Common carrier accident death- $20,000</li>
                <li>Death due to act of war or terrorism (not available in all states)- $20,000</li>
                <li>Maximum for transport of mortal remains if death occurs more than 200 miles from home- $1,000</li>

              <p>There are two versions of Lincoln Heritage burial insurance. Your health will ultimately determine which one you qualify for, if any.</p>

              <p>It’s important to note that they do not have a <a href="#">build chart</a>. Your height to weight ratio will not affect your eligibility or price. The same is true with one of the companies we represent <a href="#">Royal Neighbors</a>.</p>
                
              <p>They have an immediate death benefit option which carries a full day one death benefit that has no waiting period. In addition, they also have a a Modified benefit option which does not pay out a death benefit for certain number of years.</p>
                
              <p>However, in order to qualify for either of those plans, you must not have any of their knockout conditions.</p>

              <p>Per their website, they are an independent senior advocate organization. They are not affiliated with any religion, funeral home, cemetery, or any particular funeral approach.</p>
              
              <p>Prior to 2015, anyone was able to directly obtain a membership to FCGS. However, sometime in 2015 they made a change and stopped accepting direct applications.</p>

              <blockquote class="text-center">" The FCGS membership is the reason why Lincoln Heritage agents will attempt to justify their exorbitant prices. Don’t believe a word of it. Every FCGS benefit can be achieved on your own for free without having to pay for an overpriced Funeral Advantage burial insurance plan. "</blockquote>

              <p>In a nutshell, they will help you document how you want your funeral carried out.</p>

              <p>There are many moving parts to a funeral which often requires a family to quickly make decisions about how they are going to carry out the funeral for their loved one.</p>

              <p>Basically, they will send you a couple of forms to complete. On these forms you will answer questions like:</p>

              <p>Let’s be clear on one thing.</p>

              <p>Documenting your final wishes is always a wonderful thing to do. Honestly, if you in anyway document you final wishes, your family will greatly appreciate it.</p>

              <p>You can easily document your final wishes on your own. You don’t need the FCGS to aid you in doing so.</p>

              <p>If you Google “final wishes guide”, the very first search result provides the exact same thing!</p>
                
              <p>To make it easy on you…</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li><a href="#">Here’s a good one</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">And another</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can print out a final wishes guide anywhere. The only difference is, it won’t say FCGS on it (not that it matters).</p>

								srcset="images/woman-writing.jpg 1x, images/woman-writing@2x.jpg 2x"
								alt="woman-writing" class="w-50 align-center"
							/>
              <p>If you don’t have a printer, there are many companies that will literally send you the paperwork. They too will store your wishes on file.</p>

              <p>We don’t lend much weight to a “benefit” that is available to literally every human being in the USA.</p>
                
              <p>You should absolutely document your final wishes. It will alleviate your family from having to make a lot of tough decisions when you pass away.</p>
                
              <p>However, don’t be tricked into thinking an overpriced funeral insurance policy is your only path to a final wishes guide. It’s definitely not.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">You Should Store Them With You</h3>
              <p>If you have your final wishes documented, keep these documents with your life insurance policies! What if something happens in the future, and you are no longer doing business with Lincoln Heritage?</p>

              <p>If you are no longer their client, your family will not be able to call FCGS to access your documented wishes.</p>
                
              <p>The FCGS aside, you should not rely on any external company to store these records. You should have this kind of documentation with you!</p>
                
              <p>Keep these documents along with all your life insurance policies. Keep them all together.</p>

              <p>This way, your family will have the names of the insurers they will need to contact. Additionally, they will have a complete guide to how you want your funeral carried out.</p>

              <p>If you keep these documents, you ensure your family will access them. This method leaves nothing to chance.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Benefit # 2: Funeral Funding Information</h3>
              <p>With this benefit, they claim they can help you make sure the person taking care of your final arrangements will quickly receive the money needed to pay your funeral bills.</p>
              
              <p>The obvious question is, how do they accomplish this?</p>
              <img

              <p>Lincoln HeritageThe way they make good on this claim is done merely by notifying Lincoln Heritage about the insured’s passing.</p>
              
              <p>You call FCGS, and tell them your loved one passed. They will in turn call Lincoln Heritage.</p>
                
              <p>Just the same, you could call Lincoln Heritage directly. The net result would be the same.</p>
                
              <p>Every life insurance company must be notified about an insured passing away. This is how they know to start the claim process. Who notifies the insurance company changes nothing.</p>
                
              <p>Honestly, it’s laughable to claim this as a benefit. It’s no wonder their wording on this “benefit” is totally vague and non specific.</p>
            </div>

            <!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
              <h3 class="text-center">Benefit # 3: Funeral Plan Security Service</h3>
              <p>This benefit entails them storing your funeral plan (the papers they send you) safely in their computers. Furthermore, its available to your family through a special coded ID card.</p>

              <p>This all sounds well and nice. Unfortunately, <b>this basically means nothing.</b></p>
                
              <p>As we have already stated, you should store you own funeral plan in your own home. Aside from that, your funeral plan contains no personal information like your social security number or bank information.</p>
                
              <p>If someone were to get a hold of your funeral plan, all they would know is what color flowers you want at your funeral.</p>
                
              <p>The “special coded ID card” they assign to you, is a gimmick. There are many companies that will offer you free funeral planning services. They all assign you a member number. It’s just an internal way of tracking their members.</p>
                
              <p>These ID numbers are nothing special, and certainly aren’t some unique security feature.</p>
                
              <p>This “benefit” is equivalent to a grocery store boasting about their automatic opening doors. In this day and age, every grocery store has those!</p>

            <!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
              <h3 class="text-center">Benefit # 4: Funeral Plan Activation Help</h3>
              <p>With this benefit, they say your family can simply call FCGS to notify them of your passing, and they will contact the selected funeral home. They will pass along your funeral plan, and help your family find price discounts whenever possible.</p>

              <p>This last benefit is the one what Lincoln Heritage really pushes. Per the Lincoln Heritage website, they claim FCGS saves the average family $1,800 on traditional funerals. They assert they save up to $600 on cremation services.</p>

              <img
								src="images/lhdiscount.png"
								srcset="images/lhdiscount.png 1x, images/lhdiscount@2x.png 2x"
								alt="lhdiscount" class="w-100 align-center"
              />
              <p>In a sales presentation by Lincoln Heritage, they will flaunt the immense savings the FCGS membership provides. They will tell you that the FCGS will negotiate, on behalf of your family, with the funeral homes. They claim that these negotiations very often result in savings on the funeral.</p>

              <p>This indeed may be true to some degree. How much they negotiate or how much effort they put forth is entirely unknown.</p>
                
              <p>In fact, there is no way they will clearly define exactly how this will be accomplished. If history is any indication, a lack of clarity usually is done so for a reason.</p>
                
              <p>Even if they truly do save an average of $1800 on a traditional funeral, it’s still not worth it.</p>
                
              <p>Why isn’t it worth it? Simple. It’s math.</p>
                
              <p>The extra money you have to pay for their insurance would buy you more than $1800 in additional coverage elsewhere.</p>
            </div>

            <!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
              <h3 class="text-center">Which Of These Two Options Would You Choose?</h3>
              <ul class="order_list">
                <li>Buy your burial insurance through Lincoln Heritage. Your monthly payment will be about 20%-300% more per month relative to their competitors (and you may have a 2 year waiting period). However, they might save your family $1800 on your funeral.</li>
                <li>Take the same monthly premium you were going to spend with Lincoln Heritage, and put it with another insurance company. This other burial insurance company will provide you with 20%-300% more coverage than what Lincoln Heritage provides.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>What does 20%-300% more coverage look like in real numbers? Sure, lets do the math…</p>

              <p>If you bought $10,000 in Lincoln Heritage Funeral Advantage insurance, that same premium would buy you <b>$12,000-$30,000</b> in coverage with another company.</p>

              <p>See the difference? 😮</p>
                
              <p><b>Which of those two options leaves your family with the most money after its all settled?</b></p>
                
              <p>The numbers simply do not lie.</p>
                
              <p>The other side of the “savings” coin is the fact that ANYONE can do the exact same thing. You don’t need an FCGS representative to call around for pricing.</p>
                
              <p>In today’s marketplace, every consumer understands how shopping around is the key to getting the best price on their goods and services.</p>
                
              <p>Calling 3-5 funeral homes for prices is something anyone can do.</p>

            <!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
              <h3 class="text-center">The FCGS is just a sales gimmick</h3>
              <p>Every single benefit provided by the FCGS is neither unique, special, or inaccessible elsewhere. Furthermore, ALL of these services can be easily acquired for free.</p>

              <p>Go to <a href="#">www.dignityplanning.com</a> if you want a free funeral planning service like the FCGS. It’s totally free.</p>

                <li>You can and should have you own final wishes guide. Google “final wishes guide”. Print your own and keep it with your important papers. If you want, contact us and we will email you one for free!</li>
                <li>Don’t have your family rely on any third party to notify your insurance company that you have passed. Your beneficiaries should do that themselves. Keep all your life insurance policies together so your beneficiaries know what companies to call.</li>
                <li>Tell your family to call a handful of funeral home to compare prices. Funeral homes all charge different rates, and they are all <a href="#">required to give you an itemized price sheet</a>. Your family can easily identify which one will charge the least.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Those three bullet points completely encompass the “benefits” provided by FCGS, and it won’t cost you a dime.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Why they push the “value” of the fcgs</h3>
              <p>The harsh reality is that Lincoln Heritage talks up the great value that is Funeral Consumer Guardian Society for one simple reason.</p>
              <blockquote class="text-center">" The FCGS “value” is pushed to justify Lincoln Heritage’s overpriced burial insurance. "</blockquote>
              <p>Their final expense insurance is among the most expensive on the market, but the way they make it stick to unsuspecting customers is via the FCGS membership.</p>

              <p>In the end, the FCGS is the logic they feed their patrons. It’s how they convince them why it’s reasonable to pay 20%-300% more for their final expense insurance.</p>
                
              <p>All in all, the Funeral Consumer Guardian Society is a nothing benefit. Its just a sales gimmick. It certainly is no reason why you should drastically overpay on your funeral insurance.</p>
                
              <p>They should be saying that the Funeral Advantage program assists seniors in overpaying for final expense insurance. 😈</p>

              <p>Founded in 1963, Lincoln Heritage focuses only on selling just final expense life insurance.</p>

              <p>Now they have dabbled with some term life insurance here and there, but their flagship product has always been funeral insurance.</p>
                
              <p>No Lincoln Heritage insurance review would be complete if we didn’t mention that they sell a lot of burial insurance. Presently, Lincoln Heritage sells more final expense insurance than any other insurer in the nation.</p>
                
              <p>Then again, no other insurer focuses solely on final expense, but it’s still a very noteworthy accomplishment.</p>
