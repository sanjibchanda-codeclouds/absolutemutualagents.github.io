					<p>Burial insurance, also known as final expense or funeral insurance is generally a small whole life insurance policy with affordable premiums designed to pay all final expenses. No exams are Burial Insurance Companiesrequired, serious health issues will not prevent acceptance, and coverage typically ranges from $2,000-$40,000 with most companies.
					</p>
					<p>A whole life final expense policy has very minimal fine print. Here are the most important details:</p>
					<ul class="unorder_list">
						<li><a href="#">Rates are locked in for life and cannot increase</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">Coverage is guaranteed to never decrease</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">Policy is guaranteed to never expire</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">Builds cash value you may borrow from</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Once you pass away, the insurance company will merely payout the death benefit in the form of a tax free check payable directly to the beneficiary(s). If you prefer, you can name a funeral home as the beneficiary rather than a person.</p>
					<p>There are no restrictions how the money is spent. Be it funeral related expenses or other costs such as debts or medical bills, the money can technically be used for anything. Any leftover money will remain with your beneficiary(s) not the funeral home.</p>
					
					<p>Be sure not to get confused. The terms “burial insurance”, “funeral insurance”, and “final expense insurance” all mean the same thing. Be very leery of any website that suggests these labels have different meanings.</p>
					<h3 class="text-center">How Much Does Final Expense Insurance Cost?</h3>
					<p>Most companies charge roughly $30-$100 per month for a $10,000 final expense policy.</p>
					<p>The exact cost of final expense insurance will vary from person to person because prices are determined by age, gender, health and how much coverage you purchase.</p>

						<p>Although they are not a household name, Royal Neighbors has an outstanding track record that spans over 120 years. They were one of the <a href="#">first insurance companies to insure women and children.</a></p>
						<p>They are a <a href="#">nonprofit fraternal organization</a> licensed to provide insurance, so they include (at no additional charge) many valuable member benefits to all their policyholders. You can see a list of their <a href="#">member benefits here.</a></p>
						
						<p> Their burial expense life insurance probably has the most lenient underwriting out of all the top insurance companies. This is particularly true for diabetics. In fact, it wouldn’t be too bold to claim they are far and above the most diabetic friendly final burial expense carrier in the nation 😮.</p>
						
						<p>They aren’t just for diabetics either. They can and do insure applicants of all health profiles.</p>

            <p><a href="#">Prosperity Life Group</a> is likely not an insurance company that you know of by name. However, that does not mean they aren’t trustworthy or that their insurance isn’t worth considering.</p>

            <p>  The truth is they have an excellent burial insurance plan that is a superior choice for many folks. For example, non cigarette smoking tobacco or nicotine users can all get a non tobacco rating. Prosperity will only apply a tobacco price to those who smoke cigarettes. That is a huge savings!</p>
              
            <p>  They accept a lot of very high risk health issues, will all you to <a href="#">buy life insurance for your grandparents,</a> are available in nearly all states, and have a simple instant decision application process.</p>

            <p>AIG only offers what’s called <a href="#">guaranteed issue life insurance.</a> This kind of policy has no health questionnaire or any medical assessments. Your acceptance is guaranteed. As is the case with all guaranteed issue policies, there is a 24 month waiting period before the policy will pay out a death benefit. Should death occur during this time, AIG will merely refund 110% of premiums paid.</p>

            <p>  <a href="#">AIG</a> has some of the lowest premiums for guaranteed issue life coverage relative to the other companies in the market. In addition, they are the only company that offers two free riders on every policy.</p>
              
            <p>  There’s a terminal illness rider that will allow you to access some of your death benefit if you are ever diagnosed with a terminal illness and given a life expectancy. In addition, they offer a Chronic Illness rider that will allow you to access some of your death benefit should you develop a chronic illness are unable to perform your activities of daily living.</p>
              
            <p>  Guaranteed issue burial policies are generally a last resort, but they do have their place when it comes to health issues that are so high risk you are unable to qualify for a plan that has underwriting.</p>

            <p><a href="#">Americo</a> has two different burial life expense plans. Their Ultra Protector plan is useful for a wide variety of health conditions. This plan is one of the few on the market that comes with 100% day one coverage for folks with COPD or emphysema. The Ultra Protector plan also offers immediate coverage for some other high risk conditions.</p>

            <p>  Their other plan goes by the name Eagle Premier. This particular plan is unique in various ways. One of the most significant benefits to this plan is the fact that non-cigarette smoking tobacco users can qualify for non-tobacco rates.</p>
              
            <p>  It’s also very useful, like their Ultra Protector Series, for multiple high-risk factors.</p>
              
            <p>  Regardless of your particular health issue(s), there is a good chance that Americo can offer you a low-cost funeral insurance policy that has no waiting period.</p>

            <p>Without question, <a href="#">Liberty Bankers Life</a> has one of the most unique burial policies in the country.</p>

            <p>  For example, people with COPD, emphysema, liver diseases, or kidney disease can qualify for a plan with a full day one benefit 😮. That is incredibly rare. Most carriers would absolutely impose a partial or full two year waiting period for these conditions.</p>
              
            <p>  Liberty is also one of the few companies that opens their plan up to people as young as 18. Most burial life insurance carriers start their products at age 50.</p>
              
            <p>  All around, Liberty Bankers life can be a great fit for folks with high risk health issues, and for healthy individuals. Honestly, they are a great option for just about everyone.</p>

            <p>Gerber Life’s final expense policy is a guaranteed issue whole life policy. There are no medical questions or any life/lifestyle underwriting.</p>

            <p>  Simply put, <a href="#">Gerber Life</a> will know nothing about your health. Because there are no health questions, there is a two year waiting period as is the case with all guaranteed acceptance plans.</p>
              
            <p>  It’s a competitively priced guaranteed issue policy that is suitable for people with very high risk conditions such as HIV, dialysis, cancer etc.</p>
              
            <p>  Gerber is also infamous for their Gerber grow plan children’s insurance policy. It’s a good child policy, but not the best one available.</p>

            <p><a href="#">American Amicable</a> is not a company that appeals to a broad audience. Their funeral expense policy is a great option for certain selection situations.</p>

            <p>  As one example, their tobacco user rates are quite competitive. They are typically a much cheaper option for cigarette smokers relative to other carriers.</p>
              
            <p>  In addition, they are one of the few companies that will offer non-tobacco rates to folks who smoke an occasional cigar or pipe.</p>
              
            <p>  Another very interesting aspect to their program is their rider selection. You can opt to add some interesting perks to your policy for a little bit extra each month. Some customers really like their riders.</p>
              
            <p>  At the end of the day, they aren’t a great fit for everyone, but for certain groups they are an excellent choice.</p>

            <p><a href="#">Aetna</a> is on this list for a variety of reasons. Chief among them is because they offer coverage to folks up to age 89. It’s incredibly uncommon for any life insurance company to insure applicants over 85.</p>

            <p>  Their underwriting is also quite unique. They are one of the few carriers that offer partial coverage to CHF patients and cancer survivors (must be a year out). At the same time, there are other niche health issues where they really stand out such as chronic kidney disease, extremely obesity, home health care, and mental health afflictions.</p>
              
            <p>  All around, Aetna has built a very unique product that allows them to offer great value to many seniors who are looking for funeral service insurance.</p>

            <p>First of all, final expense insurance with no waiting period does exist. In fact, many companies offer it.</p>
            <p>  For example, of the 12 companies you see on this page, 10 of them offer immediate coverage with no waiting period.</p>
              
            <p>  Now, the most important thing you must understand is that in every circumstance you must qualify for a policy that has no waiting period.</p>
            <blockquote class="text-center">
              " To get immediate coverage, you have to apply with a company where you do answer health questions. You don’t have to take an exam, but you will have to answer health questions. "
            </blockquote>
            <p>Thankfully, there are many companies available that all have diverse and lenient underwriting, so getting no waiting period coverage is usually possible.</p>

            <p>The only way for you to know if immediate coverage is possible is for you to speak with one our agents. Basically, they’ll ask you some questions on your health so they can quickly determine if no waiting period coverage is possible.</p>
              
            <p>Just know there are some situations where you 100% cannot get immediate coverage.</p>
            <p><b>If any of the conditions below apply to the person you’re trying to insure, it will be a <a href="#">modified whole life policy with a two-year waiting period.</a></b></p>
            <ul class="unorder_list">
              <li>Dialysis</li>
              <li>HIV or AIDS</li>

              <li>Hospice</li>

            </ul>
            <p>This is not an all inclusive list, but these are the most common ones.</p>

            <p>And please don’t assume you can’t get immediate coverage.</p>
              
            <p><b>If you don’t have any of those conditions, we can probably get you immediate coverage.</b></p>

            <p>Burial insurance plans were designed to accept the risk of some fairly major health issues. This means that despite some problematic ailments, you can still get a policy!</p>

            <p>  Life insurance companies understand it’s only natural to develop health challenges with age. If they only accepted the very healthy, they would have no clients!</p>
              
            <p>  Although burial expenses plans do have very relaxed underwriting, there are indeed some health issues that are so high risk that they are uninsurable. In those cases, you’ll need a guaranteed issue policy to secure coverage (see below).</p>

            <p>As mentioned above, there are some health conditions that so negatively affect life expectancy that no insurer will touch it via a policy with any sort of underwriting.</p>

            <p>  In these circumstances, a guaranteed issue policy is totally appropriate (and likely your only option). These plans have no heath questions or medical checks of any kind. Your acceptance is always guaranteed.</p>
              
            <p>  The caveat to these no health question plans is that they come with a two-year waiting period and they cost more.</p>
              
            <p>  Basically, if you die in the first two years, the insurer will refund all your money plus interest. After the two years however, your coverage will pay out in full for any reason.</p>
              
            <p>  While they are rarely needed, guaranteed acceptance plans do have their place. Click here to see all the health conditions where a guaranteed issue policy is either your only option or it’s your best option.</p>

            <p>Well if you have a pre-need policy at a funeral home, that could be a big issue since you are no longer near that funeral home.</p>
            
            <p>However, with a funeral insurance policy, you are not bound to any geographical location.</p>
            
            <p>Remember, a funeral insurance policy will merely pay out cash. It does not matter where you are. The insurance company will cut a check even if you pass away in another country.</p>
            
            <p>No matter where you go, every funeral home in the world will accept cash.</p>
            
            <p>And guess what?</p>
            
            <p>Policies for burial pay out cold hard cash tax free 😉.</p>

            <p>  So here’s the bottom line</p>

            <ul class="order_list">
              <li>The policy is provided by an insurance company that has a strong and reliable financial track record.</li>
              <li>  It protects you as much as possible as soon as possible (no waiting period if achievable).</li>
              <li>  The policy costs less than what other insurance companies will charge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Any final expense insurance plan that satisfies all three of those requirements is a plan you want to move on as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>All three elements are important, so let’s discuss each one briefly.</p>

            <h3>Financial Track Record</h3>
           
            <p>An insurance policy is only as good as the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay its claims.</p>

            <p>  If the insurance company has financial issues, you run the risk of them not being able to fulfill their promise to you whenever you call on them to honor their obligation.</p>
              
            <p>  Thankfully, this is rarely an issue anymore.</p>
              
            <p>  At this point, life insurance is science. Due to actuarial tables, it’s virtually unheard of for an insurance company to have financial issues these days.</p>
              
            <p>  The vast majority of life insurance companies today are A rated with A.M. Best, and have strong balance sheets and cash reserves.</p>

            <h3>When The Policy Protects You</h3>
           
            <p class="text-center">You may not be aware of this, but some burial insurance policies don’t fully protect you right away 😟.</p>

            <blockquote class="text-center">
              "Some policies make you wait a full two years before they will pay out a death benefit."
            </blockquote>

            <p>Let’s be clear on one thing here.</p>

            <p>  There are absolutely some health conditions where a person will be unable to obtain a policy that provides full immediate protection, but it’s uncommon.</p>
              
            <p>  Having said that, <b>the overwhelming majority of applicants can qualify for a plan that fully <a href="#">aprotects them immediately.</a></b></p>
              
            <p>  The key thing to figure out is which insurance company(s) has underwriting that allows you to qualify for instant coverage.</p>
              
            <p>  Truthfully, there is no way for you to figure this out. You need an agency such as Absolute Mutual Agents to do it for you.</p>
              
            <p>  If your health permits full instant coverage, that should be your target goal. If isn’t possible, then you should aim for a plan that provides partial coverage during the first two years.</p>
              
            <p>  Only resort to a two-year waiting period policy after you have determined that full or partial coverage in the first two years isn’t an option.</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p><b>Insider Tip:</b> We cannot stress how critical it is that you allow an agency like Absolute Mutual Agents to evaluate your health to determine if you’ll be able to qualify for an immediate death benefit. Please do not assume a two-year waiting period policy is inevitable for you. Everyday, we talk to dozens of seniors who thought they would have a two year waiting period, and we got them immediate coverage.</p>

            <h3>The Policy Cost</h3>
            <p>This one should be obvious, but so many people disregard how important this piece of the puzzle is. It can be best summed up with one simple question.</p>
            <blockquote class="text-center">
              "If everything else is equal, why voluntarily pay more money to one company when another company offers it for a lower premium?"

            <p>Most whole life final expense life insurance plans have a fairly similar cost among all the various insurers. However, someone has to be the cheapest, so why not go with them?</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">How To Find The Best Whole Life Burial Insurance</h3>
            <p>Ultimately, the way you get the best end of life insurance is done by comparing offers from multiple insurance companies to see which one suits you best.</p>
            <p><b>Here’s the thing</b></p>

            <p>  Burial life insurance is not a cut and dry one size fits all thing. Your health is MAJOR factor that governs when your policy goes into effect, and what you pay.</p>
              
            <p>  You’ll need to enlist the services of a qualified independent burial insurance agency. An independent agency is one that represents lots of different insurance companies.</p>

              />
            <p>They aren’t married to any one insurer, so they can select whichever company suits you best.</p>

            <p>  Basically, they will evaluate your entire health history, and become familiar with your goals. Then they identify which burial insurance companies view your health most favorably.</p>
              
            <p>  Your agent will identify all the funeral insurance companies that are most accepting of your health issues. Those are the ones that will offer you the best price and coverage that protects you the soonest.</p>
              
            <p>  As you can see, one call does it all when you work with an independent agency.</p>
            <p><b>Here’s what you need to look for when selecting an agency to help you find a policy</b></p>
            <ul class="unorder_list">
              <li>The agency must be independent and represent no less than 10 burial life insurance companies</li>
              <li>  They must have ample experience specifically in the insurance for final expenses market</li>
              <li>  They must focus only on this type of insurance</li>

            <h3>1) Final Expense Insurance Companies Will Not Allow You To Purchase Their Insurance Directly From Them</h3>
            <p>You read that correctly. There is not one funeral insurance company that will sell you their insurance without you going through an agency. You must buy through an agent.</p>

            <p>You are welcome to call any of them with your checkbook in hand, and they will all have the same response. They’ll all tell you to find an agent.</p>

              <p><b>Insider Tip:</b> The only exception to this rule pertains to guaranteed issue life insurance. Those policies are sold directly by insurers.

            <p>That means 99% of the life insurance companies out there, you have no clue who they are.</p>
            
            <p>Why are we saying this?</p>
            
            <p>We are telling you this because there is a really good chance that your best burial policy will probably be with an insurer whose name you are totally unfamiliar with.</p>
            
            <p>Let’s be clear on a few things</p>
            <ul class="unorder_list">
              <li>These insurance companies are equally as trustworthy</li>
              <li>They are very financially stable</li>
              <li>Not knowing their names is not bad</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think about it like this. Why do you know the name “State Farm”? The only reason you know their name is because they have literally spent hundreds of millions of dollars advertising specifically so you know their name.</p>

            <p>At the end of the day, your best burial insurance plan might be with a company that you’ve heard of. But very likely, it will be with a company that you don’t know of.</p>
            
            <p>Just be open to this idea because if you limit yourself only to companies that you know by name, you are dealing with a VERY small pool.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore (and this might sound hard to believe), most of the big-name companies that do advertise have the some of the worst final expense plans on the market.</p>
            
            <p>They are very often much more expensive, they expire at a certain age, or they come with a two-year waiting period.</p>
            
            <p>Again, be open to companies that you don’t know by name. It will only benefit you.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Why You Should Let Absolute Mutual Agents Help You</h3>
            <p>We may be biased, but it’s not without merit.</p>

            <p>Here’s why we are unquestionably the most well qualified agency to assist you in finding YOUR best burial expense insurance plan.</p>
            <ul class="order_list">
              <li><b>We have over 15 carriers to choose from.</b> Being independent means we can represent whoever we want. We aren’t married to any particular company. Our portfolio of carriers is so large so that we can impartially select which one is best for you. We don’t care which company is best for you. All we care about is doing what is best for you.</li>
              <li><b>Funeral life insurance is all we do.</b> Would you rather deal with someone who is sort of familiar with the kind of insurance you need or someone who is an expert at it? Literately, we don’t do any other kind of life insurance or any other line of insurance for that matter. If we become masters (which we are) at this kind of insurance, then and only then can we truly best help each individual who seeks our guidance.</li>
              <li><b>Your interests are our #1 priority.</b> Yes we could place you with companies that make us more money. However, we don’t do that. We will always make sure we recommend whichever final expense insurance coverage carrier is best for you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Still unsure?</p>
            <p>Call us see and friendly and helpful we are. You’ll learn very quickly why so many other people choose to work with us. Also, check out what other happy customers had to say after working with us.</p>
