								<p>Disclaimer: We are not affiliated with AARP. This is merely our review of their insurance program along with our opinions.</p>
							</div>
              <p>Chances are you probably got something in the mail from AARP (they mail like every day it seems), saw one of their online ads, or TV commercials promoting their life insurance to cover burial costs.</p>
              <p><b>Now you wondering if AARP is the best for you… right?</b></p>
              <p>So here’s what we are going to cover:</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Want to know how their policies work? … 💥Ya, we got that!</li>
                <li>Would you like to see all their rates for all their plans? … 💥Yep, we have all of them!</li>
                <li>Want to know when their plans are good, and when they are bad? … 💥We have these, too!</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Here’s the bottom line–</p>
              <p>Every <a href="#">burial insurance</a> company is unique. AARP may be right for you, but then again they may not. This review will 100% help you figure it out.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center">AARP Final Expense Options (3 Policies)</h3>
              <p>In total, AARP offers 3 different life policies.</p>
              <ul class="order_list">
                <li>Level benefit term life up to $100,000 in coverage</li>
                <li>Simplified issue whole life up to $50,000 in coverage</li>
                <li>Guaranteed issue whole life up to $25,000 in coverage</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Each policy pays out a tax free cash benefit directly to your beneficiary to cover final expenses.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center">Burial insurance AARP is provided by someone else</h3>
							<p>Believe it or not, AARP isn’t an insurance company. Many people think AARP burial insurance seniors is actually provided by AARP, but it’s not. 😯</p>

              <p>Life insurance bought via AARP is actually provided by <a href="#">New York Life.</a></p>
              <img
							src="images/aarpnewyorklife.jpg"
							srcset="images/aarpnewyorklife.jpg 1x, images/aarpnewyorklife@2x.jpg 2x"
							alt="aarpnewyorklife" class="w-75 align-center"
							/>
							<p>Ultimately, AARP is just a marketing agency. AARP just <a href="#">sells the rights</a> of their image to various insurance companies. Whichever insurance company offers the most money, that’s who AARP will endorse.</p>

              <p>Presently, New York Life holds the rights to underwrite their life insurance contracts, <a href="#">Hartford</a> handles the auto insurance, and healthcare is provided by <a href="#">United Health Care.</a></p>
                
              <p>The moment another insurance company offers more money than one of those companies, you better believe AARP will be endorsing a new company.</p>
                
              <p>In the end, every AARP burial insurance policy is unique, so they all function differently. Below you will learn exactly how each one works, and see exactly what they cost.</p>
                
              <p>Many other savoy shoppers have already learned the truth about AARP’s life insurance program which is likely why the <a href="#">consumer affairs website</a> is riddled with complaints.</p>

              <p>So how does this policy work and what’s good and bad about it?</p>
                
              <p>Your wish is our command…</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Coverage That Expires At 80</h3>
              <p>First and foremost, this particular policy completely expires once you turn 80.</p>

              <p>Crazy right?</p>
                
              <p>After all it is a <a href="#">term life insurance policy.</a> The word term is short for terminate.</p>
                
              <p>So your coverage ends at 80 and you are no longer protected.</p>
                
              <p>You don’t get any money back, and you don’t have the option to take out a new term policy.</p>
                
              <p>At 80, your only option would be to get a whole life policy with them or another company. While getting <a href="#">life insurance after 80</a> is definitely possible, it will be significantly more expensive because of your age.</p>
                
              <p>You can see for yourself how this policy works. Below is a screenshot directly from their website that clearly explains how this policy expires at 80.</p>
              <img

							alt="protection-age80" class="w-50 align-center"
              />
              <p>Remember, any offer you ever receive from AARP is an attempt to sell you this term life policy.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Premiums That Increase Over Time</h3>
              <p>In short, the premiums on this AARP death insurance will increase every five years.</p>

              <p>Take a look for yourself. Below is a another screenshot (we like to cite our sources 😎) that clearly describes how the premiums increase every five years.</p>
              <img

						<div class="content_box-sm">
              <h3 class="text-center">If The Rates Aren’t Level, What Does “Level” Refer To With AARP Funeral Insurance?</h3>
              <p>It’s really quite funny that they call this level death benefit term life insurance. 99% of insurance companies use the word “level” to denote a term life policy that has fixed premiums for the life of policy.</p>
              <p>However, AARP has pulled a fast one here.</p>
              <p class="text-center"><i>See how they put the word “level” right before the word “benefit”?</i></p>
              <img
							src="images/level.png"
							srcset="images/level.png 1x, images/level@2x.png 2x"
							alt="level" class="w-100 align-center"
              />
              <p>When they say level term, they are referring to the fact that the death benefit itself will always remain the same. While that’s certainly cool and all; it’s just not unique.</p>

              <p>98% of term life insurance policies out there have a level death benefit. You would have to search far and wide to find one that has a decreasing benefit over time.</p>
                
              <p>It’s our opinion that they do this on purpose. They want you to think the premiums are fixed until the policy ends at 80. As you now know, they do not.</p>
            </div>

            <!--contnt box-->
						<div class="content_box-sm">
              <h3 class="text-center">Term Life Rates</h3>
              <p>Staying true to the screenshot tradition in this article, below you can see an image captured from their website that shows you the prices.</p>
              <img

              />
              <p>Here’s how this works.</p>

              <p>First, identify which age bracket you fall into currently. Then look at whatever the corresponding monthly payment will be for whatever death benefit you are contemplating.</p>
                
              <p>That monthly payment will remain the same until you enter into the next age band. Once you enter the next age band, you will be subject to the new monthly rate for the age band you are in now.</p>
                
              <p>This process repeats over and over. As you can see, the last age band is 70-74. Once you hit that band, your payment will remain whatever it is until you turn 80. It’s at that point where the policy would end, and your coverage would be over with.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">How They Qualify Applicants For This Temporary Plan</h3>
              <p>To qualify you have to pass three health questions, a prescription history check, and an MIB check.</p>

              <p>With AARP final expense insurance, it’s either an accept or decline. You either have these conditions, or you don’t.</p>

              />
              <p>Below are the health questions they will ask you. If you say yes to any of these, you will not qualify.</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>In the past 2 years, have you had treatment or medication for or been diagnosed by a doctor as having heart trouble, stroke, cancer, lung disease, diabetes requiring insulin, liver or kidney disease, AIDS, AIDS related complex, or immune system disorder?</li>
                <li>During the last 2 years, for any condition, have you been admitted to or confined in a hospital, nursing home, extended care or treatment facility?</li>
                <li>In the past 3 months, have you consulted a doctor or had treatment, medication or diagnostic tests of any type?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If your medication history or MIB file reveals any treatments for any of these conditions, they will deny you.</p>

              <p>However, if you can honestly say no to all those questions, and your prescription history doesn’t conflict with those answers, you should be accepted.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Reason #1- The Price Is Too High & It Increases Over Time</h3>
              <p>If you truly want term life insurance, you can easily get a better policy with another company that has the following benefits:</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>A lower monthly premium (could be as much as 50% lower)</li>

              <p>If for some reason you are interested in term life insurance, give us a call. We have some relationships with some very reputable agencies that specialize in term life insurance.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Reason #2- A Temporary Life Insurance Policy For Final Expenses Is A Bad Idea</h3>
              <p>Here’s the questions we encourage you to ask yourself…</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Do you know when you will pass away?</li>
                <li>If you buy a policy that ends at 80, how will you pay for your final expenses after it expires?</li>
                <li>When you have no coverage because it expired, what will the financial impact be on your family considering they will now have to pay for your funeral costs?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Look</p>

              <p>If you are truly comfortable with rolling the dice and getting a policy that expires at 80, go for it. We sincerely wish you the best of luck. Unfortunately the numbers are not in your favor.</p>
                
              <p>History has shown time and time again that a term life plan as a means to pay for end of life costs is about as good of an idea as what those construction workers are doing in that photo.</p>

                <li>AARP monthly membership fees required</li>
              </ul>
              <p>AARP whole life insurance is pretty much only available upon request. You will have to specifically ask one of their agents about this policy. If you don’t, our experience shows that you will almost certainly be sold their term life policy.</p>

              <p>So let’s jump right into how this policy works…</p>
              <img

              <h3 class="text-center">Whole Life Insurance AARP Will Not Ever Change</h3>
              <p>Because this policy is whole life, it’s incredibly simple to understand. Regardless of which insurance company you buy a whole life policy from, they all work the same.</p>

              <p>You can expect the following from this AARP final expense insurance:</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Monthly payments that will never increase for any reason</li>
                <li>Death benefit is guaranteed to never decrease</li>
                <li>Coverage goes into full effect on the first day of your policy if you qualify</li>
                <li>Policy is guaranteed to never expire at any age (unlike their term policy)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>That’s about it in regards to how this policy works. As we said, whole life policies are super simple to understand.</p>

              <p>Once you get your policy, it won’t ever change, and it will payout a tax free cash benefit to your family to cover your final expenses.</p>
                
              <p>To qualify for this policy, you do need answer some health questions, and pass a prescription history check. If you scroll down a little, you can see what types of health questions they will ask.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">AARP Whole Life Insurance Rates</h3>

              />
              <p>You will notice that there are no tobacco and non tobacco rates. That’s because they do not have separate rates for tobacco users. Everyone pays the same rate whether they use tobacco or not.</p>
                
              <p>Crazy right?</p>
                
              <p>It’s true, and definitely not normal. Most life insurance companies have tobacco and non tobacco prices. This is one of the strengths behind AARP whole life insurance rates.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">How To Qualify For This Simplified Issue AARP Burial Insurance Plan</h3>
              <p>In order to qualify for whole life insurance AARP, you must be able to answer no to all of the following health questions:</p>
              <ul class="order_list">
                <li>In the past 2 years, have you had treatment or medication for or been diagnosed by a doctor as having heart trouble, stroke, cancer, lung disease, diabetes requiring insulin, liver or kidney disease, AIDS, AIDS related complex, or immune system disorder?</li>
                <li>Within the past 2 years, for any condition, have you been admitted to or confined in a hospital, nursing home, extended care or treatment facility?</li>
                <li>In the past 3 months, have you consulted a doctor or had treatment, medication or diagnostic tests of any type?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition to those health questions, New York Life will also check your medication history and MIB file.</p>
              <img

							srcset="images/riskhigh.jpg 1x, images/riskhigh@2x.jpg 2x"
							alt="riskhigh" class="w-75 align-center"
              />
              <p>If you have any medications or MIB records that are consistent with any of the conditions mentioned in those questions, they will decline you.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, the underwriting on this policy will get a lot of folks outright declined.</p>
              <h3 class="text-center">Pro’s & Con’s of AARP Whole Life Insurance</h3>
              <p>Unlike their term policy, this whole life policy from AARP is not 100% bad. If you have an affinity for AARP and you can medically qualify for this plan, it’s really not a terrible option. However, you can very likely do much better.</p>

              <p><i>So when it is good and when is it bad?</i></p>
                
              <p>Coming right up…</p>
              <h3 class="text-center">The Pro’s</h3>
              <p>Overall, the biggest pro to this policy is the fact that you will not have a waiting period if you qualify. In addition, they priced it well. It’s comparable to many other immediate death benefit whole life final expense policies on the market (but it can be beat price wise).</p>

              <p>Last but not least, since the policy is whole life the payments won’t increase, the policy won’t expire, and the death benefits won’t decrease.</p>
                
              <p class="text-center">Want to know when someone should buy this policy?</p>
              <p><b>Here’s when:</b></p>
              <p>If you are a person who has the following attributes, this whole life insurance AARP is a good deal.</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>You smoke cigarettes (other types of tobacco do not apply)</li>
                <li>You are healthy</li>
              </ul>
              <p>That’s about it. If you are a person with the above conditions, you can’t go wrong with this policy. If not, there are better and cheaper options for you with other companies.</p>
              <h3 class="text-center">The Con’s</h3>
              <p>There are two massive drawbacks to this policy. Unfortunately for AARP, they are pretty big deal breakers.</p>
              <ul class="order_list">
                <li>Price</li>
                <li>Underwriting</li>
              </ul>
              <p>First of all, you can get the same thing for as much as 25% cheaper with other <a href="#">burial insurance companies</a>. <i>A no brainer right?</i></p>
              <p><b>It gets worse…</b></p>
              <p>Due to their underwriting restrictions, the following statement is unequivocal truth.</p>
              <blockquote class="text-center">" Most applicants simply will not medically qualify for AARP whole life insurance. "</blockquote>
              <p>We know what you are thinking… <i>What sort of conditions will they not insure?</i></p>
              <p>Here are some of the most common health issues we run into. If you have any of the following health conditions, you simply won’t qualify for this AARP burial insurance seniors:</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Diabetes requiring insulin.</li>
                <li>Complications of diabetes such as retinopathy or neuropathy</li>
                <li>Heart trouble: Afib, blood thinners, CHF, fluid pills, coronary artery disease, any heart or circulatory surgery within the last 2 years, blood clots, or aneurysms</li>
                <li>Lung issues: Asthma, COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis</li>
                <li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
                <li>Systemic lupus</li>
                <li>Seizure issues</li>
                <li>Liver or kidney diseases</li>
                <li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li>
                <li>The list goes on…</li>
              </ul>
              <p>That list is in addition to the standard uninsurable conditions such as HIV, Alzheimer’s, dialysis, or organ transplants.</p>

              <p>As you can see, the only kind of person who can medically qualify for this policy is someone in pristine health.</p>
              <p class="text-center"><i>Guess what?</i></p>
              <p>If you are in pristine health, we could get you a much better price from multiple other companies.</p>
              <p><i>Want to know something else?</i></p>
              <p>If you aren’t in pristine health, AARP will decline you, but we have companies that will almost surely accept you!</p>

              <h3>Policy #3: AARP Guaranteed Life Insurance</h3>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Face Amount Options: $2,500- $50,000</li>

                <li>AARP monthly membership fees required</li>
              </ul>
              <p>AARP guaranteed life insurance is a whole life policy up to $25,000 in coverage that has no health questions. Acceptance is guaranteed as long as you meet the age requirements and are an AARP member. Because acceptance is guaranteed, there is a two year waiting period before the policy will pay out a death benefit.</p>

              <div class="note">
                <p><b>Side Note:</b> Any policy with any company that has no health questions will always have at least a two year waiting period. There is no company on the planet that has a <a href="#">guaranteed acceptance policy</a> that protects you at all during the first two years.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">AARP Guaranteed Issue Life Insurance Is A Whole Life Insurance So It Won’t Change</h3>
              <p>Because this policy is whole life, it’s not hard at all to explain how it works. In fact, you can completely understand this policy with the following bullet points:</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Premiums are fixed for life</li>
                <li>Death benefit cannot decrease</li>
                <li>Policy will not expire at any age</li>
                <li>No death benefit will be paid for non accident death during the first 2 years</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You are probably wondering- what happens if I die during the first two years?</p>

              <p>First of all, if the death is accidental, they will pay out the full death benefit even if this occurs during the first two years.</p>
                
              <p>However, if non accidental death occurs during the waiting period, New York Life will simply refund 125% of the premiums you paid.</p>
                
              <p>You can see for yourself with the screenshot below.</p>
              <img
								src="images/period.png"
								srcset="images/period.png 1x, images/period@2x.png 2x"
								alt="period" class="w-50 align-center"
								/>
              <p>Thankfully, you can’t lose anything, and 25% interest is nothing to balk about. No savings account will ever give you a return remotely close to that.</p>

              <p>That’s about it to an AARP guaranteed issue life insurance policy. After the two years is up, you are fully protected. Because the policy is whole life, it won’t ever change and you, and you can rely on it to be there when your family needs it the most.</p>

              <p>To be perfectly blunt, there are no pros to this policy. There are only con’s, and the reason is simple.</p>
              <blockquote class="text-center">" There are many other funeral insurance companies that offer the same exact guaranteed acceptance coverage as AARP, but charge much less for it. "</blockquote>
              <p><b>Why pay AARP a higher premium for what you can get elsewhere for much less?</b></p>

              <p>The cold hard reality is that aarp guaranteed acceptance life insurance is more expensive the many other companies for the exact same thing.</p>

              <p>You can find them advertising on TV, all over the internet (they do big time for funeral insurance AARP), in magazines, and they have partnerships with multiple other respected organizations such as AARP.</p>
                
              <p>They are structured as a mutual company which means they have no shareholders. With a mutual company, certain policyholders are eligible to receive dividends.</p>
