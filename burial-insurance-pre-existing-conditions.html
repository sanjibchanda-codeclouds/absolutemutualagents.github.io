          <h3>How Final Expense Life Insurance Companies Determine Eligibility</h3>
          <p>Assuming you don’t sign up for a no health question policy, every burial insurance company will assess your health to determine what you qualify for if anything.Burial Insurance With Pre-Existing Conditions</p>
          <img src="images/approved-or-rejected.png" srcset="images/approved-or-rejected.png 1x, images/approved-or-rejected@2x.png 2x" alt="approved-or-rejected" class="post_img square-shape">
          <p>Most every company will look at the following three things:</p>
          <ul class="order_list">
            <li>Your answers to their health questions</li>
            <li>A review of your prescription history</li>
            <li>A review of your MIB file for any relevant records</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After they have all this information, they can give you a firm decision regarding your eligibility.</p>

          <p>Most companies now days will render a decision within minutes of submitting your application. However, some of them can take up to three days before you know if you have been accepted or not.</p>
          
          <p class="text-center"><b>Want to know the best part about final expense underwriting?</b></p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>Every final expense life insurance company has their own underwriting standards. While an applicant may qualify with one company, they may not necessarily qualify with another.</p>

            <p>The competition among insurance companies over the years has resulted in there being great underwriting diversity.</p>
            
            <p>The net result is this: The vast majority of health issues are accepted by one or many burial expense companies. The only question is, which company will accept the conditions YOU deal with?</p>
            
            <p>That’s the key question you must answer to find you best policy. And guess what, you can rely on Absolute Mutual Agents to help you answer that question 😎</p>            
          </div>
          <h3 class="text-center">The Health Questions Are The Most Compelling Factor</h3>
          <p>When you are applying for burial insurance with pre-existing conditions, you must understand that the health questions (with every company) are the most important element. More than likely, they alone will determine what you qualify for.</p>
          <img
					src="images/health-questionnaire.jpg"
					srcset="images/health-questionnaire.jpg 1x, images/health-questionnaire@2x.jpg 2x"
					alt="health-questionnaire" class="w-75 align-center"
          />
          <p><b>Know this</b></p>
          <blockquote class="text-center">
            " If you say yes to any health question (from any company), it will unequivocally mean one of two things. At minimum it will result in a higher monthly premium. In other cases, it will mean a higher monthly premium and a modified payout of benefits during the first two years. "
          </blockquote>
          <p><b>This is important too</b></p>
          <blockquote class="text-center">
            " If a final expense company does not ask about a health issue, it means they are okay with it. For example, you will never see any final expense company ask about cholesterol (literally not a single one). They don’t ask about it because they are perfectly accepting of it. The same applies with any other health issue. "
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <!--contnt box-->
        <div class="content_box-sm">
          <h3>Prescriptions Are The Second Most Influential Factor In The Application Process</h3>
          <p>Along with the health questions, every final expense company will analyze your entire prescription history as a way to validate your health. They will look at the names of the medications, when they were first prescribed, and how often you refill them.</p>
          <img
					src="images/prescription-drugs.jpg"
					srcset="images/prescription-drugs.jpg 1x, images/prescription-drugs@2x.jpg 2x"
					alt="prescription-drugs" class="w-75 align-center"
          />
          <p>They know what medications treat which conditions. If you have a prescription in your pharmacy report that directly refutes one of your answers to the health questions, it will override your no answer.</p>
          <p><b>Here’s the deal with prescriptions</b></p>
          <blockquote class="text-center">
            " If you fill it, they will always assume you take it. Furthermore, if you fill it, they will assume you have whatever condition it’s meant to treat. "
          </blockquote>
          <p>Ultimately, no final expense carrier will simply take your word that you don’t have a condition when it’s clear that you are being prescribed medication for whatever condition is in question.</p>

          <p>Outside of the movie <a href="#">Men In Black,</a> most people have never heard of the MIB. Truthfully, we wouldn’t know of it either if we weren’t in the life insurance business 🙂</p>
          

          <p>  So what is the MIB?</p>
            
          <p>  MIB stands for <a href="#">Medical Information Bureau.</a> They are an organization that was designed to help insurance companies avoid adverse selection when underwriting insurance applications.</p>
            
          <p>  Here’s how it works.</p>
          <img src="images/health.jpg" srcset="images/health.jpg 1x, images/health@2x.jpg 2x" alt="health" class="post_img circle-shape">
          <p>When you apply for life insurance with an insurance company that participates with MIB (99% do), that life insurance company will make a brief report about you to MIB. The report will entail whatever information you disclosed in your application.</p>

          <blockquote class="text-center note">
            " The MIB does not obtain information from your doctors, pharmacies, hospitals, or any other healthcare entity. It acquires it’s information strictly from whatever insurance companies you apply with (and only information YOU voluntarily disclose). "
          </blockquote>

          <p>For example, if you tell a life insurance company that you smoke cigarettes, that will be in the report. Likewise, if you tell a life insurance company that you have kidney disease, that too will also be in the report.</p>

          <p>  When you apply for a life insurance policy, the insurer will analyze your MIB file for any relevant records. They are looking for information that may conflict with your answers to their health questions. If they find a discrepancy, they will probably suspend or deny your application.</p>
            
          <p>  The system was designed to avoid those applicants would attempt to withhold the truth. For example, if you told insurance company A that you had cancer, they would report that information to MIB. If you then applied with insurance company B, they would see that you disclosed your cancer diagnosis. You wouldn’t be able to proclaim that you don’t have cancer to company B because your MIB file directly refutes that proclamation.</p>
            
          <p>  In the end, as long as you are honest, the MIB file will probably never become an issue.</p>
            
          <p>  The great thing about MIB is it results in lower rates overall for those who are honest because it weeds out those who would attempt to mislead insurers.</p>

          </ul>
          <p class="text-center"><a href="#"><b>Click here to read the full article about burial insurance with diabetic amputations</b></a></p>
          <p>To be perfectly frank, this condition is a flat decline with most final expense companies. There are very few insurance companies that will accept this health event. Thankfully, there are still options, but they will at minimum require you pay a higher monthly premium to cover this risk. A diabetic amputation is usually indicative of overall bad health. For this reason, we strongly suggest that you will endure at least a 2 year waiting period.</p>

          <p>While you may be eligible for full first day coverage, we would need to speak with you in order to determine that. Depending on the nature of your overall health profile, it may be necessary to resort to a guaranteed issue policy.</p>
          <h3 class="text-center underline">Aneurysm</h3>

          </ul>
          <p class="text-center"> <a href="#"><b>Click here to read the full article about burial insurance after an aneurysm</b></a></p>
          <p>First of all, there are some burial insurance companies that will flat out not care if you have had an aneurysm even if was yesterday! This means you can get coverage that starts in full immediately, and comes at the lowest rate possible.</p>

          <p>There are not many final expense companies that offer this value. If you don’t qualify with them for some other health reason, other companies will not respond so favorably. These other companies will likely impose a waiting period of some kind and definitely charge you a higher monthly premium.</p>
          <h3 class="text-center underline">Angina</h3>

          <p class="text-center"> <a href="#"><b>Click here to read the full article about burial insurance with angina</b></a></p>
          <p>Having angina is indicative of some pretty serious heart issues. Chest pains are usually the result of your heart muscle not getting enough oxygen rich blood.</p>

          <p>There are two pieces of the puzzle you need to consider.</p>
          
          <p>First are the actual chest pains. Second, is the medication that is typically prescribed to treat chest pains.</p>
          
          <p>If you have actually experienced chest pains within the last year, you will unequivocally have to deal with higher rates and a waiting period. All final expense companies will ask about chest pains within the last 1-2 years.</p>
          
          <p>The medications are another story. While you may not have actually had any chest pains within the last 1-2 years, you are probably still filling a prescription for Nitro or some other pill meant to treat angina.</p>
          
          <p>The insurance companies will assume you are still afflicted by chests pains if they see you are filling a prescription for Nitro even if you don’t actually take the pill.</p>
          
          <p>Ultimately, you would need to be free of Nitro prescription fills and chest pains for at least a year in order to be eligible for immediate coverage and level rates.</p>

          </ul>
          <p class="text-center"> <a href="#"><b>Click here to read the full article about burial insurance with arthritis</b></a></p>
          <p>This one is very simple. There is no funeral insurance company that cares about arthritis. There are a few rare companies that take issue with rheumatoid arthritis, but most companies flat out don’t care.</p>

          <p>You will easily qualify for 100% immediate coverage and have access to the lowest rates offered by each insurance company.</p>
          
          <p>The only possible way arthritis could pose a problem would be if it was so bad that you were wheelchair confined, required home health care, or needed assistance with your daily activities of living (bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, taking medications).</p>

          <p class="text-center"> <a href="#"><b>Click here to read the full article about burial insurance with asthma</b></a></p>
          <p>It’s virtually unheard of for asthma to pose any problem whatsoever when applying for final expense life insurance company. The vast majority of companies will gladly accept this health condition.</p>

          <p>You will find no trouble securing the lowest rates and first day coverage that has no waiting period of any kind.</p>

          <p>In truth, Afib just isn’t a condition that most insurance companies care about. You will find that most applications don’t ask about this condition in any way.</p>

          <p>Every single client we have helped who was bi polar was able to acquire a plan at the lowest rate possible. Furthermore, their coverage had no waiting period.</p>

          <p>Fyi, having someone come over to cook, clean, or bring you stuff is totally fine. Most carriers won’t have an issue with that kind of help.</p>

          <p>It honestly does not matter when you had your blood clot because we have burial insurance companies that freely accept this health risk. Expect to pay the least amount possible and receive a policy that covers you in full immediately.</p>

          <p>Developing a blood clot often results in taking blood thinners like Plavix, Warfarin, or Coumadin. There are indeed some insurance companies that do not like these medications. With them, they will charge you more money and likely impose a waiting period.</p>
          
          <p>But check this out</p>
          
          <p>Even if you were prescribed your blood thinners yesterday, we still have carriers that won’t care. You won’t have to pay extra or endure a modified payout of your benefits during the first two years.</p>
          
          <p>The only time a blood clot will result in higher premiums would be if you had some sort of surgery to correct it. Outside of that, you won’t have any issue securing affordable coverage.</p>

          <p>Often the result of a heart attack or stroke, blood thinners are something many final expense companies view as high risk. With that, we still have some insurance companies that welcome applicants on blood thinners with open arms regardless of how long they have been taking them.</p>

          <p>It’s absolutely possible to secure coverage with no waiting period even if you first filled your blood thinner prescription yesterday. Not to mention, you can pay a rate that is the same as what a marathon runner would pay!</p>
          
          <p>Outside of a company that does not care about blood thinners in any way, the results will vary. Truthfully, lots of carriers will take blood thinners with no hesitation if you have been taking them for two years or longer.</p>
          
          <p>If you recently began your prescription for a blood thinner, hopefully you qualify with one of the companies that accepts you without any sort of penalty. If not, you are looking at higher rates and waiting periods.</p>

          <p>Just a heads up, no burial insurance companies care about basal cell skin cancer. They all specifically exclude basal cell skin cancer when they define cancer.</p>

          <p>To begin with, if you have had cancer within the last 2 years you cannot avoid a waiting period along with higher rates. Unfortunately, this puts you in such a high risk category that insurers will impose these penalties to cover the increased risk.</p>
          
          <p>However, if your had cancer over 2 years ago the doors begin to open. At the 2 year mark you begin to have access to carriers that only ask about cancer within the last 2 years. This means you can get coverage that covers you immediately, and has a cost that is consistent with that of a person who never had cancer.</p>
          
          <p>There aren’t many companies that only look back two years on cancer. At the three year mark since your last bout with cancer, virtually all doors open up. Most funeral insurance companies only ask about cancer in the prior 3 years.</p>
          
          <p>Last but not least, if you have had cancer more than once, you will have very few options. Most carriers have a question that specifically asks about having cancer more than once. If you say yes, they decline you.</p>

          <p>The key thing to understand is that every final expense company will define tobacco usage differently. Some companies may define it as any form of tobacco or nicotine, and some just care about cigarette usage.</p>

          <p><b>Here’s the deal</b></p>
          
          <p>There are some companies that specifically exclude chewing tobacco when they determine if an applicant is subject to tobacco rates. Furthermore, some companies only ask about cigarette usage.</p>

          <p><b>Here’s the deal</b></p>
          
          <p>Most final expense companies will subject cigar smokers to tobacco rates. At the same time, there are some companies (not many) that will not.</p>
          
          <p>The companies that specifically allow for cigar usage will allow you to qualify for non tobacco rates. This could mean a savings of up to 80%!</p>

          <p>To clarify, a circulatory surgery is any operation on the veins or arteries. The two most common are stent placements or an angioplasty.</p>

          <p>The health questions for every burial insurance company will always inquire about a circulatory surgery. You will find they ask about this event within the last 12 months or the last 24 months. It’s incredibly rare to find a company ask about a circulatory surgery beyond the 24 month mark.</p>
          
          <p>If you have had a circulatory surgery within the last year, you will be subject to a full waiting period and a higher monthly premium. If you had one over 12 months ago but less than 2 years, some companies will offer you level coverage (not many).</p>
          
          <p>After it’s been 24 months since your last circulatory surgery, it’s a non issue at this point. Almost every company will take you without hesitation, and not impose any sort of penalty on you.</p>

          <p class="text-center"><a href="#"><b>Click here to read the full article about burial insurance with cirrhosis</b></a></p>
          <p>What usually happens with most funeral insurance companies is they impose higher rates and a partial or full waiting period when they encounter an applicant who has cirrhosis. Having said that, not all companies are created equally 🙂</p>

          <p><b>So here’s the bottom line</b></p>
          
          <p>You cannot avoid having to pay an increased monthly premium if you have this condition. Sadly, this is a fairly high risk condition which is why all final expense companies charge more because of it.</p>
          
          <p>The great news is that some companies will still offer you full first day coverage. We are talking no waiting period of any kind. Truthfully, there aren’t many companies that offer this incredible value, so hopefully you don’t have any other health issue that get in the way.</p>

          <p>Most people don’t know this, but lower respiratory diseases are the third leading cause of death in the United States. This is why the majority of burial insurance companies will not view this health issue favorably.</p>

          <p>If you are on oxygen for your COPD it’s a flat decline with every company. If you are in that situation, a guaranteed issue policy is your only path to new coverage.</p>
          
          <p><b>Here’s what you can expect</b></p>
          
          <p>Thankfully, there are some good options out there. Best case scenario is you qualify with the one company (there is literally only 1) that takes this condition with open arms. They won’t charge you more money or impose a waiting period of any kind.</p>
          
          <p>If you don’t qualify with that company, you are looking at a higher premium with one of the few companies that still offers full first day protection.</p>
          
          <p>Lastly, the remaining companies will all charge you a higher premium, and impose a graded payout on your benefits or subject you to a full two year waiting period.</p>

          <p>It would be quite the task to find a burial insurance company that even has the words “crohn’s disease” on their application. They will not ask about this condition because they don’t view it as a risk factor. You will easily qualify for instant coverage, and pay the lowest price offered by the insurance companies.</p>

          <p>The only way there could be a complication in the process would be if you have ever filled a prescription for Mercaptopurine or Cyclosporine.

          <p>If you have had a heart or circulatory surgery within the last year, you are going to have to pay more money and endure a waiting period.

          <p>First of all, all burial insurance companies lump dementia and Alzheimer’s into the same category. They all respond to both afflictions the exact same way.</p>

          <p><b>Here’s the deal</b></p>
          
          <p>Both of these condition are a flat decline. Because of this, your only option is to take out a guaranteed acceptance funeral insurance policy. These have no health questions or underwriting. They simply issue the policy to everyone who applies.</p>
          
          <p>Now there is a two year waiting period, but that cannot be avoided. No life insurance company on the planet will issue any coverage to a dementia patient that protects them at all during the first two years. It’s simply doesn’t exist.</p>

          <p>Diabetes is an all too common health factor we encounter. A good portion of final expense clients deal with diabetes in some way. This is probably why there are so many insurance companies that freely accept this condition.</p>

          <p>First, if you have controlled diabetes, you will have no trouble qualifying for rock bottom rates and instant coverage. Even if your weight is not so good, it won’t matter.

          <p>  The most compelling factor is time. When you had your diabetic coma will be the single greatest factor that determines what options you have.</p>
            
          <p>  Basically, if you have had a diabetic coma within the last 2 years, you are looking at higher monthly payments. Most companies will flat decline you, but there are some that will still take you with a higher premium.</p>
            
          <p>  There is only one company that offers immediate coverage to someone who has had a diabetic coma within the last 2 years. If you don’t qualify with them, you are looking at a full two year waiting period will all other companies.</p>

          <p>When it comes to heart attacks, the factor that really determines every is time.</p>

          <p>When you last had a heart attack will ultimately determine what options you have and what you pay.</p>
          
          <p>First, if you have had a heart attack within the last year, you will pay more and be subject to a full two year waiting period. There is no funeral insurance company that will not respond this way if you have had a heart attack within the last year.</p>
          
          <p>If it’s been a year since your heart attack then you have more options. Basically, there are a few companies out there that only ask about heart attacks within the last year. These companies will offer you immediate coverage, and their lowest rates since you heart attack was over a year ago.</p>
          
          <p>After it’s been two years since your heart attack, it’s no longer a factor. Pretty much every burial insurance company asks about heart attacks within the last two years. Since it’s been longer than that, they don’t care. You’ll get instant coverage and low rates.</p>

          <p>Basically final expense companies are going to be concerned with when you had the heart surgery. You will find the insurance companies ask about heart surgeries within the last year or last two years.</p>

          <p>If you have had a heart surgery within the last year, expect higher premiums and a waiting period. After it’s been a year some companies will offer you level coverage. There aren’t many of them though.</p>
          
          <p>At the two year mark pretty much all final expense companies no longer hold the heart surgery against you. At this point you should expect level coverage from most carriers.</p>

          <p class="text-center"><a href="#"><b>Click here to read the full article about burial insurance with hepatitis</b></a></p>
          <p>To be perfectly forward about this matter, there is no company that won’t charge you a bit of a higher premium. The reality is hepatitis is a fairly high risk condition which is why all final expense companies do this.</p>

          <p>The good news is there some insurance companies that will offer you full first day coverage. There aren’t many of them, so we pray you don’t have some other health issue that poses a problem with qualifying with one of these companies.</p>
          
          <p>If you happen to not qualify with one of the companies that offers immediate coverage, you are looking at a variety of responses. Usually you will be offered a higher premium along with a graded payout or a higher premium and a modified pay out.</p>
          
          <p>For what it’s worth, a graded plan is one where the insurer will payout a percentage of your death benefit if you die within the first two years. It’s typically 30% during year one, and 70% during year two.</p>
          
          <p>A modified plan is one where the insurance company will not pay any death benefit if you die within the first two years. Instead, they would merely refund all your money plus interest (usually 10%).</p>

          <p>This one is easy. We can proclaim the following statement without hesitation.</p>

          <p>There is no final expense life insurance company that will ever care about an applicant who takes medication to manage high blood pressure.</p>
          
          <p>All companies will offer you full first day coverage and their lowest rates.</p>
          
          <p>There are some (not many) who take issue if your blood pressure has ever been out of control. Even that did happen to you, most companies don’t even care.</p>

          <p>It’s truly amazing how far HIV treatment has come in the last two decades. Patients of this disease are able to live long healthy lives as long as they follow their treatment plan.</p>

          <p>While great strides have been made treating this horrible disease, it’s unfortunately still a very high risk condition when it comes to life insurance.</p>
          
          <p>So here’s the deal</p>
          
          <p>You cannot get coverage that has underwriting (health questions). Your only path to securing a new policy is via guaranteed issue life insurance.</p>
          
          <p>These policies guaranteed coverage to anyone who applies. As long as you meet the age requirements, you will be accepted.</p>
          
          <p>There is a two year waiting period before your policy will pay out any benefits. If you were to pass away during this time, the insurance company would refund all your money plus interest.</p>
          
          <p>Just know there is no way to avoid a waiting period because of the HIV or AIDS.</p>

            <li>Permanent home health care</li>
            <li>Temporary home health care</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For starters, if you are permanently receiving home health care, rejoice because there is a company that will still accept you! Just know there is only one, so hopefully you have no other health issues that will prevent you from qualifying with them.</p>

          <p>They will honestly give you full immediate protection, and the lowest rate possible. You will pay no more for your insurance than what a very healthy person would pay.</p>
          
          <p>If you are receiving temporary home health care coverage, you should wait until it’s over with. We say this because there are a good amount of final expense companies that only ask about current home health care.</p>
          
          <p>If you wait until your home health care is over with, poof you qualify with these companies! This means level rates and first day coverage.</p>

          <p>You may or may not know this, but most final expense companies have a build chart among their underwriting guidelines. A build chart will list max weights according to a person’s height.

          <p>Simply having a pacemaker is generally not an issue with the majority of burial insurance companies. The only time it becomes an issue is if you had it installed with the last 2 years.</p>

          <p>Essentially, if you had it installed within the last year, you will be subject to higher prices and a full two year waiting period.</p>
          
          <p>If you had it installed over a year ago but less than two years, some companies will offer you level coverage. However, there aren’t many of them that only look back one year on a heart or circulatory surgery.</p>

          <p>There are some final expense companies that allow pipe smokers to qualify for non tobacco rates. This could mean a savings as much as 80% on your monthly premiums.</p>

          <p>First of all, having sickle trait is a non issue with every company. Being a carrier is not a mortality risk factor which is why all final expense companies could care less about it.</p>

          <p>Sickle cell anemia is very different than sickle trait. However, the results are going to be relatively the same when it comes to applying for burial insurance.</p>
          
          <p>Most companies won’t ask about this condition which means they accept it. There are only a few out there that view this condition negatively.</p>
          
          <p>Here’s the bottom line</p>
          
          <p>You can get covered. You will pay the lowest rate possible. Your coverage will not have a waiting period.</p>
          
          <p>This is important to consider</p>
          
          <p>Complications that could arise from SCD could have a big impact on your eligibility. For example, having a recent stroke is something that will change things. There are many different side effects that could derive from the sickle cell anemia. Speak with your Absolute Mutual Agents agent about all your health conditions, so they can give you a clear understanding of what to expect.</p>

          <p>All companies have tobacco rates for smokers. The thing is, some companies have better tobacco rates than others.</p>
          
          <p>No question you have to pay a higher premium because you smoke. The key is to find which companies offer the best tobacco rates. We have quite a few companies that specialize in their tobacco rates. These companies will give you the best rates on your policy.</p>
          
          <p>It’s important to note that no final expense company will ever decline you because you smoke. Furthermore, no company will ever subject you to a waiting period either. Smoking simply means you have to pay more money each month.</p>

          <p>Before going any further, we need to be very clear about something. This section only pertains to full blow strokes. None of this section relates to TIA mini strokes. The outcome for a TIA attack is very different than that of a full blown stroke.</p>

          <p>Like many other health issues, a stroke can potentially cause a person to pay more for their burial insurance. The date of the stroke is the only factor that will determine whether or not your stroke impacts your price.</p>
          
          <p>To start off with, if you had a stroke within the last 12 months you cannot avoid having to pay a higher monthly price. In addition, every insurance company will impose a two year waiting period on your policy.</p>
          </p>
          <p>If your stroke was over a year ago but less than 2 years, you have much better options. Basically, there are a handful of final expense life insurance companies that only ask about strokes within the last 12 months. This means you would be able to say no to their stroke question because it was over a year ago.</p>
          
          <p>In the end, that makes you eligible for their immediate coverage and their lowest rate. Just a heads up though; there are not many companies that only look back 12 months on strokes. Most companies look back 2 years.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, if your stroke was over 2 years ago, you are in the clear. It’s unbelievably uncommon for any final expense company to ask about strokes beyond the 2 year mark. At this point, your stroke is not a risk factor anymore.</p>
          
          <p>The only way your stroke could be a risk factor beyond the two year mark would be if it caused some paralysis. There are many things to consider when it comes to paralysis. By default, paralysis itself does not mean you will have to pay more or endure a waiting period.</p>
          
          <p>If your paralysis caused you to need things like home health care, or assistance with your daily activities of living, those are variables that could complicate things. Ultimately, you need to reveal everything to your Absolute Mutual Agents agent, so they can give you a firm set of expectations.</p>

          <p>First, if you are in a wheelchair due to a chronic illness or disease (Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, etc), you are totally ineligible for any coverage that has underwriting (health questions). In this scenario, your only path to new coverage is by way of a guaranteed issue funeral insurance policy.</p>
          
          <p>A guaranteed acceptance policy is one where the insurance company just issues it without assessing your health in any way. As long as you meet the age requirements, you qualify. These policies do cost more given the fact that the insurer is taking on substantially more risk. In addition, they always come with a two year waiting period.</p>
          
          <p>If you are in a wheelchair and not because of a chronic illness or disease (you were born this way, you had a stroke, etc), then you can qualify for level rates with some companies. Your coverage would begin immediately, and you would qualify for the lowest price offered by these insurance companies.</p>
