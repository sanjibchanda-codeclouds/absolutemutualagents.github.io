							<h3 class="text-center">How Does Mutual Of Omaha Burial Insurance Work?</h3>
              <p>United of Omaha burial insurance is whole life insurance with lenient underwriting, so seniors with health issues can qualify. Policy amounts range from $2,000 up to $40,000.</p>

              <p>These plans are primarily meant to pay for burial and other funeral expenses, but the money can be used for anything.</p>
              <img

								srcset="images/policy.jpg 1x, images/policy@2x.jpg 2x"
								alt="policy" class="w-75 align-center"
								/>
              <p><b>Keep this in mind</b></p>
              <p>The term “burial insurance” is simply a marketing phrase that has been used for decades. It’s common to also see the words “funeral insurance” or “final expense insurance” used along with “burial insurance”.</p>

              <p>All three of these phrases mean the same thing. There is no difference. For example, “Final expense insurance from Mutual of Omaha” is no different than saying “burial insurance from Mutual of Omaha”</p>
                
              <p>Just don’t get confused if you see us or another website use these three terms interchangeably.</p>
                
              <p>Because it’s a <a href="#">whole life policy</a>, it’s super easy to understand. So easy in fact three sentences is all you need.</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Fixed premiums that can never increase</li>
                <li>Permanent policies that cannot expire</li>
                <li>Coverage that cannot decrease in value</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We told you they were simple.</p>

              <p>Since it’s life insurance, your beneficiaries will get a tax-free cashier check for whatever amount of coverage you purchased. This gives them the necessary funds to pay for your end of life costs.</p>
                
              <p>And there are no restrictions how the money is used. This is great because every single funeral home in the nation will take cash.</p>
                
              <p>If there happens to be money left over, which oftentimes there is, that money will simply stay with your family.</p>

              <p>United of Omaha’s <a href="#">final expense policy for seniors</a> that offers full day one coverage is called <a href="#">“Living Promise”</a> (that’s just the name they gave it).</p>
              <p>Living Promise has two plans you could qualify for. There is a level death benefit and a graded death benefit.</p>

              />
              <p><b>If you are approved for the level benefit, it does not have any waiting period.</b> You would be fully insured from the very first day.</p>

              <p>If you are approved for the graded benefit, that one has a two year waiting period.</p>
                
              <p>During the first two years of the graded plan, they would merely refund 110% of all premiums if the insured were to pass away for any non accidental reason.</p>
                
              <p>On the graded plan, accidental death pays out 100% even during the waiting period.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">How To Qualify</h3>
              <p>As we said, to get United of Omaha funeral insurance with no waiting period, it’s something you qualify for. You won’t need to take an exam or physical. Qualification is based on the following three factors:</p>
              <ul class="order_list">
                <li>Answers to the health questions</li>
                <li>Prescription history analysis</li>
                <li>Information in your MIB file</li>
              </ul>
              <p>By far, the health questionnaire is the largest factor that determines if you’re eligible for the level benefit no waiting period plan. All their questions require a simple yes or no answer (shown a little further down below).</p>

              <p>In addition, they will check your prescriptions to see if you’ve been treated for any of the health conditions that are asked about on the application.</p>
                
              <p>Finally, they will also analyze your MIB file for any relevant records. FYI, <a href="#">MIB stands for Medical Information Bureau.</a></p>
              <img
								src="images/underwriting.jpg"
								srcset="images/underwriting.jpg 1x, images/underwriting@2x.jpg 2x"
								alt="underwriting" class="w-75 align-center"
              />
              <p>When you apply for life insurance, that insurance company will make a report about you to MIB. Their report will contain whatever information you revealed.</p>

              <p>For example, if you said you have cancer right now, their report would contain your cancer diagnosis.</p>
                
              <p>Insurance companies like Mutual of Omaha check MIB so they can ensure applicants are being honest.</p>
                
              <p>So let’s say you told Company ABC that you have cancer, but you attempt to tell Company XYZ that you do not.</p>
                
              <p>Well Company XYZ would see that your MIB file indicated that you told Company ABC that you did have cancer. This would definitely impact your application with Company XYZ.</p>
                
              <p>Don’t worry too much about MIB though. As long as you’ve been honest with other companies, you have nothing to worry about.</p>
                
              <p>Now you’re probably wondering… What health issues do they not accept?</p>
                
              <p>The health questions are listed below.</p>
                
              <p>Make sure you pay attention to the time frame for each section.</p>
                
              <p>To qualify for their immediate coverage level benefit, you must be able to say no to all questions in part one and part two.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Living Promise Has 2 Policy Riders</h3>
              <p>For starters, not all these riders are available in all states.</p>
              <p>Mutual of Omaha funeral insurance plans come with one free built in rider and one option rider.

              <p>First, every living promise final expense insurance policy will come with the following riders. You do not pay for these. They come bundled with the policy at no extra cost.</p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li><b>Terminal Illness:</b> If you are diagnosed with a terminal illness and given 12 months or less to live, you can accelerate up to 50% of your death benefit while still alive. Whatever amount you accelerate will reduce the death benefit accordingly.</li>
                <li><b>Nursing Home Confinement:</b> You can accelerate up to 50% of your death benefit if you are confined to a nursing home for 90 consecutive days or expect be indefinitely.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>There is one optional rider you can purchase that will cost extra which is the Accidental Death Rider. This rider would double the payout of the policy if you were to pass away due to an accident.</p>
              <p>Please note, you cannot add on the accidental death rider if you are approved for the graded plan. The ADR can only be added to the a United of Omaha final expense level benefit plan.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Mutual Of Omaha Guaranteed Issue</h3>
              <p>Mutual has probably the most price competitive <a href="#">guaranteed issue policy</a> in the nation. There are very few situations where you can find a guaranteed acceptance plan at a lower rate.</p>

              <p>Even other low cost GI carriers such as <a href="#">AIG</a> or <a href="#">Gerber</a> have trouble matching their rates.</p>
                
              <p>To be clear, a guaranteed issue policy is one where there is no medical or lifestyle underwriting. No health questions, exams or any health information required.</p>
                
              <p>With guaranteed issue, the insurer literally knows nothing about your health.</p>

              <p>Now</p>
              <blockquote class="text-center">" The main thing you need to be aware of about guaranteed issue policies is that they ALL (no exceptions) have a minimum two-year waiting period. "</blockquote>
              <p>During the waiting period United of Omaha will not payout the death benefit. Instead, they would give you back all your money and tack on 10% interest.</p>

              <p>After two years, they’ll payout the full amount for any reason.</p>
                
              <p>Please note that during the first two years, they will pay out 100% of the death benefit if death is the result of an accident (car crash, lightning, fall off a roof, etc).</p>
              <p><b>Here’s a breakdown of their guaranteed issue plan</b></p>
              <ul class="unorder_list">
                <li>Available in all states except CT and MT</li>
                <li>Issue ages are 45-85 (75 in NY)</li>
                <li>Face amounts are $2,000-$25,000 (minimum is $5k in WA)</li>
                <li>Sold directly from Mutual of Omaha (not sold through brokers like Choice Mutual)</li>
                <li>Full 2 year waiting period</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can see a list of their <a href="#">policy details here</a>. On their site, you can even get instant quotes and fully apply if you wish.</p>

              <p>Since United of Omaha’s guaranteed acceptance plan has no health underwriting, there are only two ways you would not be eligible.</p>

								srcset="images/guaranteedapproval.jpg 1x, images/guaranteedapproval@2x.jpg 2x"

              <p>The first is if you live in a state where they don’t sell it.</p>
                
              <p>The second would be if you do not have the mental capacity to enter into a legal contract. For example, if you had advanced Alzheimer’s and are no longer able to sign a contract, you would not be eligible.</p>
                
              <p>Outside of those two reasons, you cannot be turned down for any reason.</p>

              <p>United of Omaha and mutual of Omaha are the same company. They just issue all their life products under the name United of Omaha.</p>

              <p>You’ll see us use both names interchangeably because they are the same entity.</p>
